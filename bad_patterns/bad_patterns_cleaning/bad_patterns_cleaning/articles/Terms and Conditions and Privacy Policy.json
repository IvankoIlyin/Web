News • analysis • podcasts • reports Sign Up I accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\nThe new element of its 'lodging-as-a-service' platform can recover up to 10 per cent of a typical multinational corporation's hotel budget, says the company.\nHRS customers must opt-in to start reclaiming their VAT and the service is provided at 'net no cost' – HRS' recovery costs are covered via a percentage of successfully collected funds.\nThe corporate lodging platform has also introduced a free reclaim calculator on its website, allowing travel and finance leaders to insert their metrics and see an estimate of how much VAT they may be able to reclaim using the new solution.\nHRS CEO Tobias Ragge said: 'Estimates of unclaimed VAT globally exceed $30 billion annually. Far too many companies don't even collect a penny. At a time when travel budgets face major scrutiny, this reality is unacceptable.\n'This solution holds immense promise, enabling the potential to recover 100 per cent of domestic and foreign lodging VAT.'",

News • analysis • podcasts • reports Sign Up I accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\nThe deal, which was announced at the Dubai Airshow, will see Emirates purchasing 55 Boeing 777-9s and 35 777-8 aircraft. The airline will also add another five 787 Dreamliners to its order book with the US manufacturer.\nSheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, who is chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline and Group, said: 'The 777 has been central to Emirates' fleet and network strategy of connecting cities on all continents non-stop to Dubai.\n'We are pleased to extend our relationship with Boeing and look forward to the first 777-9 joining our fleet in 2025.'\nThe new orders means that Emirates now has 205 aircraft from the 777 family of aircraft on order, while the number of new Dreamliners set to be delivered in the coming years goes up to 35.\nStan Deal, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, added that the order was an 'incredible vote of confidence' in the company's range of widebody aircraft.\n'The 777-9 and 777-8 are the perfect airplanes to support Emirates' growth, improving environmental performance and unmatched payload capability along the way,' said Deal.\nMeanwhile Boeing has also announced a deal with another Dubai-based airline, Flydubai, for 30 Dreamliners as the carrier looks to 'diversify' its fleet by adding long-haul aircraft.\nFlydubai wanted to use these aircraft to 'open new routes and grow capacity on existing routes'. Like Emirates, the carrier is also owned by the Dubai government.\nGhaith Al Ghaith, CEO of Flydubai, added: 'Innovation is at the heart of everything we do at Flydubai. We are committed to offering the right product at the right time to cater to the changing market and customer needs.'\nCurrently the airline operates a fleet of 79 Boeing 737s with another 137 of these aircraft on order.",

        "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a Morning Meeting livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Wednesday's key moments. 1. U.S. stocks were mixed in midmorning trading Wednesday, with the S & P 500 mainly flat and the Nasdaq Composite down 0.13%. More broadly, the market has been bolstered by mega cap technology stocks of late, with Club holding Microsoft (MSFT) closing at a new all-time high on Tuesday. Meanwhile, bond yields were little changed Wednesday morning, with that of the 10-year Treasury hovering around 4.5%. And oil prices fell to their lowest levels since July, as West Texas Intermediate crude fell more than 2% to trade at $75.75 a barrel. 2. Club holding Walt Disney (DIS) reports quarterly results after the closing bell Wednesday. A disappointing quarter and lack of strategic initiatives could sway investors to favor activist investor Nelson Peltz, should he choose to pursue a proxy battle . Crucially, Disney will have to show improving profitability at its direct-to-consumer unit, which houses its streaming operations. Can the company lay out synergies now that it is fully acquiring Hulu ? And does Disney have plans to pursue strategic partnerships around its linear television offerings like ESPN? That's necessary given the weak advertising market. 3. Citi on Wednesday said it expects Club holding TJX Companies (TJX) to deliver a third-quarter beat and guidance raise when it reports on Nov. 15, citing continued momentum at its HomeGoods department store. The firm has a buy rating and price target of $103 a share on TJX stock. Expectations are certainly high since off-price retail has been a favored theme of investors – but expectations were also elevated last quarter and TJX delivered.

        "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a Morning Meeting livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments. 1. U.S. stocks edged up in midmorning trading Tuesday, as the market continues to consolidate last week's gains. The S & P 500 gained 0.36%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed nearly 1% on the back of technology stocks. A quarterly beat and guidance raise from Datadog (DDOG) was lifting enterprise software names like Club holdings Salesforce (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL), Jim Cramer said Tuesday. Meanwhile, bond yields moved lower, with that of the 10-year Treasury hovering just above 4.5%. And oil prices tumbled more than 3%, with West Texas Intermediate crude trading around $78 a barrel. 2. Barclays on Tuesday raised its price target on Club holding Constellation Brands (STZ) to $293 a share, up from $280, while maintaining an overweight rating on the stock. The firm argued Constellation is shifting to be an operator from a builder, focusing on improving efficiencies across the business — including by removing about $1 billion from its brewery expansion plans. That \"clearly demonstrates improved efficiencies and further de-risks capital allocation by meaningfully improving the ROIC profile and allowing for greater share repurchase,\" Barclays analysts wrote. And as a result, Constellation stock \"could go much higher,\" Jim said Tuesday. Shares were trading up 0.45%, at roughly $242.60 apiece. 3. Club holding Coterra Energy (CTRA) reported strong quarterly results after the closing bell on Monday, while delivering better-than-expected free cash flow . The company also increased its full-year production guidance while leaving its capital expenditure outlook unchanged, signaling greater capital efficiency. Meanwhile, Club name Emerson Electric (EMR) missed on analysts' expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter on Tuesday. Stay tuned for a full Club analysis on the results later in the day. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.) As a subscriber to the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer, you will receive a trade alert before Jim makes a trade. Jim waits 45 minutes after sending a trade alert before buying or selling a stock in his charitable trust's portfolio.

U.S. stocks were consolidating gains Monday on the heels of their best week in nearly a year , with the S & P 500 up 0.18% in midmorning trading. Bond yields also moved higher, with that of the 10-year Treasury back above 4.6%, but remained well off highs of nearly 5% seen in recent weeks. And oil prices jumped after major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia reaffirmed their commitment to extra voluntary production cuts through the end of the year. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 1.9%, to trade around $82 a barrel. Meanwhile, the S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator flipped into overbought territory, at 4.14%. But we're still looking to put some cash to work after selling 250 shares of Foot Locker (FL) on Friday. 2. Club holding Walt Disney (DIS) named a new chief financial officer Monday, poaching longtime PepsiCo (PEP) CFO Hugh Johnston. This is a \"great hire\" for Disney, as Johnston has a reputation as one of the best CFOs in corporate America, Jim Cramer said Monday. Disney reports quarterly results Wednesday after the closing bell, with fiscal year 2024 guidance in focus. It's crucial that the company continue to show improvement ahead of what could be a bruising proxy fight with Trian Partners' Nelson Peltz. 3. Club name Coterra Energy (CTRA) reports third-quarter results after the closing bell Monday, with the post-earnings conference call scheduled for Tuesday morning. We hope to see improving well productivity with continued capital discipline. Other Club companies reporting this week include Emerson Electric (EMR) on Tuesday before the opening bell and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) on Thursday after the close.

        "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a Morning Meeting livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Friday's key moments. 1. U.S. equities climbed higher Friday, with the S & P 500 up 0.47% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.74%. Both indices are on track to deliver gains for the week after stocks gave their best performance in a year last week. \"I do think this rally is real,\" Jim Cramer said Friday. Bond yields, meanwhile, were mainly steady, with that of the 10-year Treasury hovering around 4.6%. And oil prices jumped by more than 1%, with West Texas Intermediate crude trading at nearly $77 a barrel. 2. Morgan Stanley said Friday that it expects Club holding Palo Alto Networks (PANW) to pull further away from the cybersecurity pack and sustain high-teen-billings growth. Analysts at the bank said they would be buyers into the print, ahead of Palo Alto's quarterly results Wednesday after the closing bell. That's a view we articulated this week, too. Morgan Stanley's latest checks \"largely support a positive view, with partners citing durable demand as customers consolidate on the broader PANW platform,\" the analysts wrote in a research note. Palo Alto stock gained 3.64% Friday morning, to trade at $251.42 a share. 3. Club name Coterra Energy (CTRA) reported strong quarterly results earlier in the week, raising its production outlook while keeping capital expenditures in check. The oil-and-gas producer is also still estimating about 5% deflation next year thanks to contract repricing. As a result, Jim said Friday that he \"would be an aggressive buyer of Coterra\" at current levels. He's set to interview CEO Thomas Jorden on \"Mad Money\" Friday evening. Shares of Coterra were down 0.17% Friday morning, at $26.76 apiece. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long PANW, CTRA. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

        "description": "The market is roaring Tuesday, with Treasury yields falling in response to a softer-than-expected October consumer price index report.",
        "content": "We are selling 75 shares of Emerson Electric (EMR), at roughly $88.49 apiece. Following Tuesday's trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 525 shares of EMR, decreasing its weighting in the portfolio to 1.61% form 1.84%. The market is roaring Tuesday , with Treasury yields falling in response to a softer-than-expected October consumer price index report. Based on the mild inflation data, investors are likely concluding that the Federal Reserve may no longer need to raise interest rates further, allowing for a so-called soft-landing for the economy. But even with Tuesday's outsized moves — the S & P 500 has jumped more than 2% — we are staying disciplined by adhering to the S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator , which shows the market to be squarely overbought. As such, we need to replenish our cash reserves at these higher levels. We are, therefore, further reducing our position in Emerson Electric . The decision comes after we sold some shares Monday on concerns about execution following the company's weaker-than-expected earnings report and outlook last week. To be sure, Emerson has valuation on its side, with shares trading at a significant discount to its five-year average. And given the stock is so cheap, we think it has the potential to bounce back. But our concerns over management's execution and its questionable acquisition of National Instruments override valuation, which is why our plan is to slowly sell the stock into pockets of strength. With EMR up about 2% Tuesday, we'll realize a loss of about 7% on stock we first purchased last December. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long EMR. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

        "content": "Shortly after the opening bell Wednesday, we will be buying 75 shares of GE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC), at roughly $66.17 apiece. Following the trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 1,245 shares of GEHC, increasing its weighting in the portfolio to 3.06% from 2.88%. With U.S. equities down in premarket trading Wednesday and the S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator still highly oversold, at minus 5.36%, we are putting money to work on the expectation the market could soon bounce. And we're targeting the stocks of companies that have already reported solid quarters this earnings season, but have pulled back from recent highs due to the broader market sell-off. GE HealthCare Technologies is a prime example. The medical equipment maker on Tuesday reported strong third-quarter results , beating expectations on revenue and earnings with solid margin expansion. The stock soared more than 5% on the news, but is still down roughly 20% since July. The big surprise in the earnings report was GE HealthCare's resilience in China, amid concerns about an anti-corruption campaign targeting the country's health-care industry. But both revenues and orders increased year-over-year in China, easing investor concerns. The company also told a compelling story around expected margin expansion due to a raft of new product introductions, including those integrated with artificial intelligence that command a much higher price point relative to legacy offerings. We also think the market is still underappreciating how well the company is positioned to benefit from the rollout of new Alzheimer's treatments, which require brain scans provided by GE HealthCare's technology. As margins expand over time, the stock should command a higher price-to-earnings multiple from the roughly 15-times to 16-times it trades at today, bolstering our decision to build out our position.

        "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a Morning Meeting livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Thursday's key moments. 1. U.S. stocks were mainly lower in Thursday morning trading, with the S & P 500 down 0.13% after eight-straight sessions of gains. But \"this is a profit-taking day. I don't want you to fret,\" Jim Cramer said Thursday. Meanwhile, bond yields were mainly flat, with that of the 10-year Treasury hovering around 4.5%. And oil prices climbed by nearly 2% after a string of recent declines that have pushed the commodity to lows last seen in mid-July. West Texas Intermediate crude was trading around $76.80 a barrel. 2. Club holding Walt Disney 's (DIS) quarterly results Wednesday showed CEO Bob Iger is making progress on his turnaround plan , sending the stock up nearly 7% Thursday morning, to around $90.30 a share. Guidance for free cash flow of about $8 billion for fiscal year 2024 came in well above analysts' estimates and was up from the $4.9 billion reported for fiscal 2023. Losses at the entertainment giant's direct-to-consumer unit, which houses its streaming operations, also continued to narrow. At the same time, Disney's incoming chief financial officer , Hugh Johnston, should \"be a godsend in terms of the stability of the story,\" Jim said Thursday. 3. Club name Wynn Resorts (WYNN) reports third-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday, with the casino operator's business in Macao, China, in focus. Gross gaming revenue in the gambling hub has come in better than expected of late. More broadly, Wynn's rivals, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and MGM Resorts (MGM), have posted better-than-expected earnings this season that bode well for Thursday's release. Jim encouraged investors to \"buy the stock if you don't own any.\" Shares of Wynn were down 0.3% in midmorning trading, at $92.60 apiece. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long DIS, WYNN.

Jim waits 45 minutes after sending a trade alert before buying or selling a stock in his charitable trust's portfolio.

U.S. stocks rose Thursday, with equities on track for their fourth-straight day of gains. The S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up roughly 1.5% in midmorning trading. Bond yields, meanwhile, pulled back after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was hovering at just above 4.6%. And oil prices edged up by around 0.7%, with West Texas Intermediate crude trading at roughly $81 a barrel. 2. Club holding Starbucks (SBUX) reported much better-than-expected quarterly results Thursday, sending its stock soaring by 10%, to $100.50 a share. The coffee maker delivered dynamic margin expansion at 18.2%, compared with 15.1% during the same period last year. Meanwhile, Club name Eli Lilly ( LLY) also delivered an earnings beat Thursday, even as the pharmaceuticals firm slashed its full-year guidance on charges related to recent acquisitions. Several big drugs missed on revenue, but in our view there is only one line that matters: Mounjaro revenue of $1.41 billion beat estimates of $1.28 billion despite intermittent delays fulfilling orders. Eli Lilly stock was up more than 5% in midmorning trading, at $582.58 a share. Stay tuned for a full Club analysis of both earnings reports later Thursday. 3. Club holding Apple (AAPL) is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter results after the closing bell Thursday. Wall Street expects sales to be mainly flat year-over-year, while earnings-per-share should climb around 10 cents on an annual basis. We'll be looking closely for any commentary Apple management provides on the current quarter. \"I say own it, don't trade it,\" Jim Cramer reiterated Thursday. \"It's not about quarters. If it were about quarters, you would have left\" a while ago, he added, explaining Apple remains a long-term play regardless of quarterly performance. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long SBUX, LLY, AAPL. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

        "description": "Apple's earnings are on deck Thursday after the close.",
        "content": "Now that the majority of the so-called Magnificent 7 have reported earnings with mixed reactions, Apple (AAPL) is on deck this Thursday after the close. Apple's valuation is a concern for me given the current interest rate, macro, and geopolitical environment. Trading at over 26 times forward earnings, AAPL's valuation does not reflect the uncertainty with discretionary spending into the end of 2023. Look to Alphabet's earnings where the market reacted poorly to the Google-parent's uncertainty around advertising revenue, a reflection of concerns around consumer spending. Additionally, AAPL's valuation does not seem to fully reflect the contagion risks with China, where nearly 20% of its revenue is derived and where consumer spending is at risk. With analysts expecting about 8% EPS growth for 2024, this feels optimistic. In my opinion, for AAPL to simply sustain this valuation when it reports Thursday, it would need to post not only strong revenue and profit numbers, but provide a positive surprise to its guidance for 2024. While there are some potential bright spots such as India and potential gains from AI, my hunch is that the hurdle is simply too high for the current environment. Looking at a chart of AAPL, its recent break below key support level of $172 is concerning, suggesting that there is potentially further downside to its next significant level of support, which is just below $150. The trade To play for a decline towards that level, I'm going to use a trade structure that I prefer for earnings when options are expensive. I'm looking out to the December expiration and buying the $170/$155 put vertical at a $3.94 Debit. This is buying the $170 puts while selling the $155 puts against it to offset the cost of the long puts. Risking a total of $394 per contract if AAPL remains above $170 at expiration to potentially make $1,106 if AAPL is below the $155 short strike at its expiration date. This gives me an over a 2:1 risk to reward ratio on this trade if AAPL declines on earnings.

        "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Friday's key moments. 1. U.S. equities moved higher Friday, on track for a fifth-straight day of gains. The S & P 500 rose 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.94%. Stocks were bolstered by the Labor Department's monthly employment report , which showed hiring slowed in October. Nonfarm payrolls increased by just 150,000 last month, while wage growth came down and the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9%. \"If I wanted to see a number going the right way for employment, it would be this one,\" Jim Cramer said Friday. The news is the latest sign inflation is decelerating, and could allow the Federal Reserve to end interest-rate hikes. Bond yields retreated on the report, with that of the 10-year Treasury hovering around 4.5%, down from around 5% two weeks ago. 2. Club holding Apple (AAPL) on Thursday reported a 1% year-over-year decline in total revenues for its fiscal fourth quarter . But importantly, iPhone and services revenues beat analyst expectations. Total earnings-per-share soared 13% on annual basis. Meanwhile, Club name Starbucks (SBUX) also reported fiscal fourth-quarter results Thursday that showed the coffee maker is \"hitting on all cylinders,\" according to Jim. With shares up more than 3% Friday, Jim said that \"this is the beginning of the next leg of Starbucks.\" 3. Next week is another busy one for Club companies reporting quarterly results. Coterra Energy (CTRA) reports Monday after the closing bell, with production and capital expenditures in focus. Emerson Electric (EMR) reports Tuesday before the bell, with investors looking for initial guidance for 2024. Walt Disney (DIS) releases its earnings report after the closing bell on Wednesday, and we'll be looking for an update on the integration of streaming platform Hulu into Disney+. And Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is set to report Thursday after the closing bell, with the market expecting strong revenue and profit margins from its operations in Chinese gambling hub Macao.

        "description": "Airline stocks have already lost about a third of their value in the last three months, yet hotel shares have held up fairly well.",
        "content": "As airlines continue to add capacity after a year of record demand for revenge travel, consumer demand after the pandemic is showing signs of slowing. Prices for many routes in 2024 are now priced significantly lower than this previous summer for both economy and business class tickets. Interest in travel across Europe and Asia is looking softer into 2024. Airline stocks have already lost about a third of their value in the last three months, yet hotel shares have held up fairly well. .XAL YTD mountain NYSE Arca Airline Index YTD With over 75% of its international revenue generated from Europe and Asia, I see the risk that a hotel stock like Marriott (MAR) will play catch-up with the declines that we've seen from airlines over the past few months. If we look at a chart of MAR, we see that it broke out above its key $180 resistance level to a new all-time high back in July. After trading to a new all-time high above $210, it's now back on a downtrend and likely to revisit its $180 support and potentially breakdown further below that. Additionally, MAR currently trades at over 22 times forward earnings, which looks ambitious, especially as guidance provided for the rest of 2023 has been revised lower. My concern is that we are going to see further negative guidance in future quarters as the economic and geopolitical risks rise. If we look at the implied volatility of MAR options, it isn't particularly high, however the skew between at-the-money options and out-of-the-money options are quite high and provide a unique opportunity to sell a neutral to bearish call spread. I'm looking out to the Dec 22 Weekly expiration to sell the $195/$205 call vertical spread. I'm able to collect $4.02 in credits which is just over 40% of the vertical width. (Reminder a vertical spread involves buying or selling options with same expiration but different strikes.) This strategy would risk $598 per contract if MAR is above $205 by the Dec 22 expiration and have a maximum gain of $402 per contract if MAR simply trades below $195 at expiration. So, if the stock declines or even if it stays puts, we will make the potential max profit on this trade. Additionally, with a credit spread, I would set a stop loss if I lose 100% of the premium that I've collected at around $8.00 debit.

        "description": "With the stock down about 20% since September, we continue to see the recent sell-off as a buying opportunity.",
        "content": "We are buying 50 shares of Oracle (ORCL), at roughly $105.18 apiece. Following Wednesday's trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 775 shares of ORCL, increasing its weighting in the portfolio to 3% from 2.82%. Software giant Oracle hasn't reported this earnings season — the company is so-called off-cycle, with its next release expected in December — but we believe recent industry commentary bodes well for the company and are, therefore, adding to our position. Across the cloud-computing landscape, revenue growth at Microsoft 's (MSFT) Azure accelerated in the third quarter, while revenue at Amazon 's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services stabilized during the period. Alphabet 's (GOOGL) Google Cloud missed on analyst expectations, but we expect it to be the outlier. Looking ahead, investors are waiting on the cloud industry to hit an inflection point and return to accelerating growth. When analyzing the surge in spending from mega cap tech companies on data centers and artificial-intelligence chips, it's clear demand will be strong for quite some time. And that tracks with recent statements from Oracle that demand is growing faster than its supply of chips can keep up with. As Oracle gets its hands on more chips from the likes of Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), it will be able to book more and more business. Notably, Oracle stock is still trading a few dollars lower than the level it reached ahead of the company's AI Executive Forum event on Oct.19. The stock lost roughly 6% thereafter on investor concerns that the revenue contribution from AI workloads will take longer to recognize than previously thought. But as noted when we added to our position on Oct. 23, the sell-off was an overaction. Whether Oracle starts to see a meaningful contribution from AI in fiscal year 2024 or 2025 is up for debate. But either way, those gains are coming, giving us confidence in management's ability to deliver on its fiscal 2026 financial goals. With the stock down about 20% since just before Oracle reported fiscal first-quarter results in September, we continue to see the recent sell-off as a buying opportunity.

        "content": "Developed by Avalanche Software, Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world action RPG set hundreds of years before the events of Harry Potter, in the 1800s.\nAs a fifth-year student who joins Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry late, players must master spells, brew potions and tame magical beasts - all while attempting to uncover a hidden truth that could destroy the Wizarding World.\nSo, how much space do you need to jump into Hogwarts Legacy without the need to Alohomora your Switch? Head below for all the details as well as what we're expecting to see in the day one patch.\nHow big is the file size for Hogwarts Legacy on Switch?\nHogwarts Legacy. Warner Bros Games\nWB Games has outlined that players who purchase both the standard and deluxe physical editions of Hogwarts Legacy will require approximately 7GB of space to play the game.\nA further 8GB will be needed due to a day one patch - for a total of 15GB storage space. On top of this, an additional 1.5GB will need to be assigned for every extra language pack download.\nWhen it comes to purchasing Hogwarts Legacy via the Nintendo eShop, players will similarly need 15GB to accommodate the game - and, again, a further 1.5GB for every language pack added.\nStay ahead of the game!

Games\nThe day one patch for Hogwarts Legacy is sizable, at 8GB – that's larger than the game itself.\nWhile details have not been revealed by the developer yet, it's fair to assume that this will feature general stability tweaks, optimisations and any fixes that could cause crashes. That's going off the day one patch that happened for other consoles and PCs upon launch.\nIt's also worth noting that developers tend to limit the storage on cartridges for Nintendo Switch due to the cost.\nSpeculation is making its way across the web that the reasoning would also be to cut licensing fees on the Nintendo console. Once the patch is out, we'll update this piece with the relevant, official details.\nHogwarts Legacy is scheduled to launch on 14th November 2023 for Nintendo Switch. The game can also be played across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC now.\nListen to our One More Life podcast, subscribe to our free newsletter and follow us on Twitter for all the latest gaming intel.\nLooking for something to watch?

        "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a Morning Meeting livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Monday's key moments. 1. U.S. equities came under pressure Monday, with the S & P 500 down 0.16% in midmorning trading. The move lower comes after two strong weeks for stocks that has seen Club names like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all climb higher since reporting quarterly results. Those gains have come despite little upside surprise in any of their reports and have largely been driven by a retreat in bond yields. \"We've had a series of ugly wins, but they're wins,\" Jim Cramer said Monday. He added that \"homework matters\" regardless of support from the bond market, as it helps investors to know when to hold on to quality stocks. Bond yields, meanwhile, were little changed Monday morning, with that of the 10-year Treasury hovering above 4.6%. 2. Over the weekend, Novo Nordisk (NVO) presented the full results from a closely watched study around its GLP-1 weight-loss drug, Wegovy, which has shown a 20% reduction in risks of major adverse cardiovascular events. Wall Street analysts have largely reacted positively to the presentation, with many arguing it should increase prescriptions of GLP-1s and support broader insurance coverage — with positive implications for Novo's chief rival, Club holding Eli Lilly (LLY). Jim said Monday that there are two factors insurance companies will look at when considering whether to cover these drugs: obesity and blood pressure. \"They want blood pressure down,\" he added. 3. Piper Sandler said that Club holding Microsoft 's (MSFT) Ignite conference , which gets underway Wednesday, \"could emerge as the next catalyst\" for the software giant's stock. The company \"remains in the early stages of capitalizing on its first-mover advantage in generative AI,\" Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a research note Sunday. The company is expected to give updates around its artificial-intelligence assistant, 365 Copilot, and other enterprise products during the event. Microsoft is the one megacap tech company that has rallied and didn't need to rely on falling bond yields – it delivered a true upside surprise with its quarterly results and has kept us highly bullish on the stock.

The S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both oscillating between small losses and gains. Jim Cramer said that there's currently a \"disconnect\" in the market, but added: \"This, too, shall pass.\" The market continues to be highly oversold, at minus 6.03%, according to the S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator . Bond yields, meanwhile, pulled back slightly ahead of a closely-watched decision Wednesday from the Federal Reserve on whether to raise interest rates further. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was hovering just above 4.8%. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil climbed 0.85%, to trade around $83 a barrel. 2. Club holding Caterpillar (CAT) delivered strong quarterly results Tuesday, even as investor concerns over its backlog and margins peaking sent shares tumbling roughly 6%, to around $227.60 apiece. But Jim said the decline could prove a buying opportunity. \"I would like to buy some CAT when it gets to $225,\" he said Tuesday. Meanwhile, Club name GE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC) also reported solid quarterly earnings Tuesday, pushing shares up by nearly 7%, to $67.54 each. \"This is a $70 stock at a minimum,\" Jim said, urging investors not to sell it. Stay tuned for a detailed Club analysis on both earnings reports later Tuesday. 3. New U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China could cancel billions of dollars in upcoming orders for Club holding Nvidia (NVDA), The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. A spokesperson for Nvidia said the artificial-intelligence chipmaker is working to allocate those chips to customers in the U.S. and around the world, while reiterating that the export controls will not have a meaningful impact in the near term. Jim said Tuesday that there is so much demand in the U.S. from mega cap technology firms that Nvidia can absorb the hit . (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CAT, GEHC, NVDA.

        "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments. 1. Stocks are rallying Tuesday after the October consumer price index (CPI) came in cooler than expected, increasing expectations that the Federal Reserve is done raising rates. This is great news for our stocks. \"We've been big fans of what [Fed Chair] Jay Powell is doing and staying the course and our portfolio reflects that,\" Jim Cramer said Tuesday. Treasury yields fell sharply, with the 10-Year dropping below 4.5%, its lowest level since late September. In addition, the dollar index fell to its lowest level in several weeks, which helps multinationals like Procter & Gamble (PG) that benefit from the weaker dollar. Jim Cramer says PG is a buy here . 2. Other names in the portfolio should get a boost from the end of the hiking cycle. Stocks tied to housing like Stanley Black & Decker (SWK). Ford (F) as auto loan rates come down. High-multiple stocks in software and chips that should see PE expansion. Morgan Stanley should get a lift as investment banking activity returns. In the company's post-earnings call in October CEO James Gorman said: \"The minute you see the Fed indicate they've stopped raising rates, the M & A and underwriting calendar will explode because there is enormous pent-up activity.\" 3. Nvidia (NVDA) is on pace to notch its 10th consecutive session of gains, its longest streak since December 2016. Morgan Stanley raised its revenue estimates for the January quarter by about $1.5 billion and fiscal year 2025 by nearly $6 billion. The analyst says the data center supply chain continues to ramp rapidly. Shares of NVDA are up more than 2% this morning. \"They're basically making gold, and gold is in short supply,\" Jim said. 4. Club holding TJX Companies (TJX) reports third-quarter earnings Wednesday before the bell. Off-price should be one of the few groups in retail that is thriving right now because they offer quality merchandise at discount prices. We're expecting continued strength in Homegoods, MarMaxx, and hope to get some guidance from management if marketplace still favorable for TJX.

        "description": "Disney's plan to buy the remaining stake of Hulu will give it full ownership of the platform, allowing it to merge its streaming operations on one app.",
        "content": "Walt Disney 's (DIS) plan to buy the remaining stake of Hulu will give it full ownership of the platform, allowing it to merge its streaming operations on one app while generating fresh advertising opportunities. Disney, which already owns 67% of Hulu, announced Wednesday it had agreed to acquire the remaining stake from Comcast (CMCSA) in a deal valued at $8.61 billion. The transaction, which reflects the guaranteed minimum value of $27.5 billion for the streaming service the two sides agreed upon in 2019 , is expected to close by Dec. 1. Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. \"There should be a few advantages of Disney having full ownership of Hulu and integrating its content with Disney+ to create a one-app platform,\" Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis, said in regards to Disney's primary streaming service. The deal is also \"expected to create more opportunities for advertisers, which has become more and more important in Disney's pursuit of a growing advertiser tier,\" he added. Disney stock climbed 2.4% Thursday, to trade at roughly $83 a share. Hulu already exists as part of a streaming bundle with Disney+ and ESPN+. But the new ownership structure should allow Disney to create a more valuable streaming service as a single product under the Disney+ umbrella. That could help the company to attract new subscribers and increase its advertising revenue. DIS YTD mountain DSI stock performance year-to-date. Disney's widely expected deal to acquire the remainder of Hulu comes as the company continues to struggle to make its streaming business profitable, even if losses have been narrowing of late. But the development of a one-stop-shop for all Disney's streaming content should at least enhance the customer experience, while also improving engagement. Hulu currently has 48 million subscribers and maintains a library of more than 70,000 TV episodes and movies. That compares with Disney+'s 146.1 million worldwide subscribers. Still, Disney faces ongoing challenges around the fate of ESPN and its lagging linear television business, which could continue to weigh on the company when it next reports quarterly results on Nov. 8.

        "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a Morning Meeting livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Wednesday's key moments. 1. U.S. stocks climbed higher Wednesday morning, building on the market's gains over the past two days. The S & P 500 rose 0.52% ahead of the Federal Reserve's expected policy decision on interest rates later in the day. Investors widely expect the central bank will hold rates steady, but the question is whether it's done hiking altogether given the recent uptick in government-bond yields has helped further tighten financial conditions. The yield on the 10-year Treasury pulled back Wednesday, to just under 4.8%. Meanwhile, the S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator showed the market to be highly oversold, at minus 5.36%, prompting us to add to our position in GE HealthCare (GEHC). 2. Club holding DuPont (DD) delivered a quarterly earnings beat Wednesday, even as the company missed slightly on analyst expectations for revenue. The stock fell 4.8% after management shaved its net sales outlook and moved its guidance for operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to the low end of its existing range. But Jim Cramer said he would be a buyer of DD at current levels. Meanwhile, Club name Humana (HUM) also delivered an earnings beat, even as the stock pulled back roughly 4% Wednesday after the company failed to raise its full-year outlook. \"I think Humana is excellent, and the sellers have created an opportunity,\" Jim said. He added: \"I would be a buyer at the end of the day.\" 3. Club holding Estee Lauder (EL) reported another disappointing quarter Wednesday, once again pushing out the timeline for its expected turnaround. While the prestige beauty firm said it had returned to growth in the U.S., it cut its outlook for 2024 again to reflect the slower pace of recovery in sales and margins due to ongoing headwinds in China. Jim on Wednesday called the Club's investment in Estee Lauder a \"mistake.\" \"I offer a mea culpa because I did think [CEO Fabrizio Freda] could turn around\" the company, he said. But now, we're focused on finding the next winner. Stay tuned for a detailed analysis on all three earnings reports later Wednesday. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long GEHC, DD, HUM, EL.

        "content": "The scene, where RoboCop brutally stopped a violent attack by a man on a woman, has become the stuff of legend.\nListen to our One More Life gaming podcast now!\nSure, that film spawned a bunch of sequels and heaps of merchandise (and even a shiny reboot in recent-ish memory), with its brutal action being remembered fondly alongside its tongue-in-cheek political satire and big sci-fi ideas.\nAnd the deadpan performance from Peter Weller, who reprises his role in the new game, is always praised by fans.\nBut let's be honest here: The penis-shooting scene is probably the most meme-worthy moment from that original flick, and as such it has earned a spot in the internet's collective memory.\nIt has even spawned a T-shirt slogan!\nSo, how does RoboCop: Rogue City pay tribute to this moment? Take a look at the fun social video clip below to find out! And warning: it contains strong violence and adult themes.\nAs you can see, the developers at Teyon have not shied away from this groin-destroying moment in RoboCop history. In fact, it looks like they've embraced it with the full permission of their publishers at Nacon.\nThat's right, folks. If you shoot an enemy 'down there' in RoboCop: Rogue City, you'll be rewarded in a very official way with a trophy/achievement!\nTitled Zip This Up, the trophy's bashfully described unlock condition is listed in the official materials as 'shoot an enemy in a sensitive spot'.\nIt's totally up to you if you want to dispense the iconic line to yourself afterwards. \"Your move, creep...\"\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy. You can unsubscribe at any time.\nIn fact, shooting enemies in their nether regions counts as a critical hit in the game, making the iconic move a genuinely useful trick to have up your sleeve in combat.\nIf this wasn't enough of an incentive for you to check out this game, have a read of our full RoboCop: Rogue City review, where we dub this first-person shooter as 'the ultimate 1980s movie tie-in game'.\nYou can order RoboCop: Rogue City from traditional online retailers like Amazon, or straight from the store on your platform of choice. We've also seen some good deals over at CD Keys.\nTrust us, there's lots of fun to be had even after you've unlocked this trophy!\nRoboCop: Rogue City is out now on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.\nListen to our One More Life podcast, subscribe to our free newsletter and follow us on Twitter for all the latest gaming intel.\nLooking for something to watch?

We went to Kuwait, all over, including a military base in England.\n\"When I was there, I met one of the first female combat helicopter pilots that had served in the Gulf War. She was a big reader and we'd talk for hours on end, and I thought, 'I need to create a character like this'.\n\"I'm always looking for a character I haven't done before – and almost the entire book is written from her perspective.\"\nHarlan went on to say that Maya's reintegration back into civilian life following her military service plays a big role in Fool Me Once.\n\"What happens when that person is trying to come back into the real world, the distance and the disconnect that they sometimes will feel? How do I throw that into a compelling mystery story?\"\nCoben also teased \" the most shocking ending\" to the series, adding: \"One of the things I hope we've done well for people, and one of the reasons that the shows [I've previously done] have been popular, is... you have to actually deliver on the ending.\n\"It's sort of a powerhouse emotional ending, and I think our last episode, which is also unusual, is our shortest episode.

For the top manager from Silicon Valley, cycling has become a daily ritual – a forced break from the stressful everyday life.

        "content": "Microsoft (MSFT) stock notched all-time highs this week, and we expect shares will soar even higher through the end of the year on the back of artificial intelligence. Microsoft stock has been on its longest winning streak in four years, recording nine-consecutive sessions of gains as of Wednesday. Shares of the software giant, which have climbed over 50% year-to-date, closed out Wednesday at a record $363.20 apiece. After a pullback over the summer, the stock started trending higher in September and then surged on the company's fiscal first-quarter results late last month. The report was Microsoft's biggest earnings beat in more than two years, helped by an acceleration in revenue at cloud-computing unit Azure and increased adoption of its AI offerings. The software company has bet big on AI over the past year, harnessing its partnership with startup OpenAI to integrate the technology across its business. For example, the company earlier this year launched a new version of its Bing search engine that incorporates technology stemming from OpenAI's viral ChatGPT. Microsoft has invested roughly $13 billion in OpenAI. On Monday, OpenAI unveiled its most powerful AI tool yet , GPT-4 Turbo, during an event that featured an appearance from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. And shares of Microsoft notched fresh gains on the heels of the announcement. MSFT YTD mountain Microsoft (MSFT) year-to-date performance Microsoft at the start of November started officially selling 365 Copilot , an AI add-on for the company's suite of Office applications used by businesses. The AI assistant, which utilizes ChatGPT's large language models , should generate a new recurring revenue stream for Microsoft. \"Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it,\" Nadella said in late October prior to the tool's general launch. Meanwhile, Piper Sandler on Thursday reiterated that Microsoft is one of its \"highest conviction ideas to own into year-end.\" Analysts at the firm have previously forecasted that Copilot could bring in over $10 billion in annualized revenue for Microsoft by 2026. The Club maintains a $400-per-share price target on Microsoft stock and a 1 rating, meaning we would be buyers at current levels. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long MSFT .

        "content": "Constellation Brands ' (STZ) push to reduce costs gives us increased confidence that the Corona and Modelo beer maker can deliver strong future growth and create additional value for shareholders. The part about maximizing cost savings was a major takeaway in Monday's research note from Barclays, which summarized last week's Constellation Investor Day. The analysts called attention to management's comments about the \"next phase\" of their transformation from a builder of more beer capacity by increasing square footage to an operator that utilizes its existing footprint in the most efficient way possible. Management said that by optimizing its beer expansion efforts, the company was able to reduce $1 billion in expenses. These cost savings enable meaningful improvement in Constellation's return on invested capital profile, according to Barclays, which allows the company greater stock buyback flexibility to create even more value for shareholders. The analysts also raised their price target on the stock to $293 per share from $280 and kept their buy-equivalent rating. Jim Cramer was encouraged by the Barclays note, saying on Tuesday that Constellation is \"doing a lot of things right,\" citing its solid beer business that offers GARP, \"growth at a reasonable price.\" STZ YTD mountain STZ performance year-to-date. We also covered Constellation's Investor Day last week, when the company played up its strong Mexican beer portfolio and tried to reassure investors that its struggling Wine & Spirits unit is on a better trajectory. Our Friday story highlighted the company's decision to reiterate medium-term growth expectations for beer and target low double-digit earnings-per-share growth, excluding losses from its stake in cannabis firm Canopy Growth (CGC). We were also encouraged by Constellation's disciplined capital allocation plans. However, we were disappointed the company didn't announce plans to offload Wine & Spirits, something we would have expected activist investor Elliot Management to advocate. Our views Friday and Barclays analysis Monday certainly reflect the thinking behind the Club's decision on Oct. 25 to add more shares of Constellation around $236 each. We bought back some of the 100 shares we trimmed when they were 9% higher back in July. Since last month's trade, shares of Constellation were up roughly 3%.

        "description": "Last week's mind-boggling rally following the Federal Reserve's decision to forgo another rate hike caught many investors by surprise.",
        "content": "\"Bulls take the stairs up, bears take the elevator down\" underscores the typical market behavior, where bullish trends exhibit a gradual ascent with occasional minor setbacks, while bearish corrections and pullbacks tend to be swift and steep. However, last week's mind-boggling rally following the Federal Reserve's decision to forgo another rate hike caught many investors by surprise. Conventional wisdom implies that this surge was largely influenced by a short squeeze, and any signs of weakness may trigger rapid profit-taking, potentially leading to a pullback Based on this thesis, I want to make a bearish bet on the SPDR S & P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) using a trade structure called a bear put spread. To further support my bearish bias, I am using the following criteria I am using 2 technical indicators in the chart below: 50-day simple moving average: In down trending markets, the 50-day SMA acts as resistance. SPY is hovering around the 50-day SMA, which is approximately at $433. RSI (Relative Strength Index): Counter-trend relief rallies are common in bear markets. But you will notice that the area around $60 usually acts as resistance where these counter-trend rallies fizzle out. In SPY's chart below, RSI is flattening out around $60 which indicates stalling upward momentum. The trade set-up: A bear put spread Now that I have a directional bias in place, all I need to do is find a trade structure which will allow me to bet on a downward move in SPY. The trade structure I am going to use here is called a 'bear put spread' also known as a 'put debit spread'. SPY is a highly liquid ETF and if you glance at its option chain, you will notice that it offers $1 wide strikes. This is great, because traders can construct a $1 wide put spread and risk as little as $50 to make $50 per winning trade. To increase risk, traders simply add more contracts. Eg. doing a 100-contract trade would risk $5,000 to make $5,000. All I need is for SPY to drop by $1 by expiration date for this trade to double my money. Here is the exact trade setup: Buy $434 put Dec 1 expiry Sell $433 put Dec 1 expiry Limit Price: 50 cents Profit target: If SPY is trading at $433 or below on expiration date, this trade will generate a 100% return on investment on the amount risked. Managing losses: An important part of any profitable trading system is that it needs to have positive expectancy. That means the winners need to add up to more than the losers. For me to create positive expectancy with this trading strategy, I will close this trade if I lose 50% of my investment (i.e. 25 cents). By doing this, every winner will cancel out two losing trades.

        "content": "The season will go on to explore the eventual marriage between then-Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, which has recently re-entered the public eye since their coronation as King and Queen of the United Kingdom.\nOlivia Williams, who portrays Camilla on the show, told press that the series will examine her long road to acceptance within the family, with a significant payoff arriving in the final scene.\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\"I still maintain, again through the script and what my impression is, that Camilla wasn't hungry for power or thrones or crowns,\" she began, \"but that she could see how important acceptance was to Charles, that he needed approval from his family, and particularly from his mother, for Camilla.\nWilliams continued: \"And to see that denied in someone you love is very hard, to see them look for approval from their parents and not get it. So, it was building to this tremendous moment, in the very last episode, in the very last moments of the last episode, when the Queen finally accepts Camilla and is warm and complimentary to her.\"\nThere have been mixed opinions about Charles and Camilla, particularly in the wake of Diana's death, but Williams argues there is no need to pit the King's two wives against each other.\nElizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana in The Crown. Netflix\n\"It was a dreadful situation,\" she explained. \"It's like a subject at school, the causes of the Second World War. How did we get to a place in society where Charles ended up marrying Diana? That was just an extraordinary anomaly that was no particular person's fault.\nMore like this\n\"But moving forward, Charles and Camilla have shown that their marriage is an excellent one, and that she is the perfect companion to our King and so I did feel that deserved some credit, and also the fact that she really still hasn't written [her story].\nRead more:\nWilliams added: \"Where is the book? 'Camilla, her Story, Camilla, in her Words', you know? She has been provoked and provoked and provoked, and has never risen; she's a better woman than I.\"\nThe actor, also known for roles in The Nevers and The Halcyon, has played Camilla in seasons 5 and 6 of The Crown, co-starring opposite Dominic West (Prince Charles) and Imelda Staunton (Queen Elizabeth II).\nThe Crown season 6 part 1 is streaming on Netflix from Thursday 16th November 2023.

        "description": "The energy sector has been beaten down since September and is stuck in a downtrend.",
        "content": "The energy sector has been beaten down since September and is stuck in a downtrend. However, markets don't usually go up or down in a straight line. When markets go into oversold or overbought conditions, it is common to see counter-trend rallies. In the chart below, I am using the SPDR Energy ETF (XLE) , which is an ETF that tracks the performance of companies in the energy sector like Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Pioneer Natural Resources and Valero. To evaluate the trading action in XLE, I am using 2 technical indicators in the chart below: RSI (Relative Strength Index): You will notice that RSI almost touched the oversold region on Nov. 9 and is started to bounce back up. This is an indication that the stock has lost downward momentum and could be changing its current trend. DMI (Directional Movement Index): DMI is composed of 3 lines, DI+ (green line), DI- (red line) and ADX (blue line). When the DI- (red line) is above the DI+ (green line), it indicates a downtrend which is what XLE is experiencing at the moment. However, when the DI lines start changing direction, it indicates a possible change in the current trend. Note that both DI- and DI+ are changing direction which provides further confirmation that XLE is turning around. The Trade Set-up: A bull call spread Now that I have a directional bias in place, all I need to do is find a trade structure which will allow me to bet on an upward move in the energy sector. The trade structure I am going to use here is called a 'bull call spread' also known as a 'call debit spread.' XLE is a highly liquid ETF and if you look at its option chain, you will notice that it offers $1 wide strikes. This is great, because a trader can construct a $1 wide put spread and risk as little as $50 to make $50 per winning trade. To increase risk, simply add more contracts. For example, doing a 100-contract trade would risk $5,000 to make $5,000. All I need is for XLE to go up by $1 by expiration date for this trade to double my money. Here is the exact trade setup: Buy $83 call Dec 8 expiry Sell $84 call Dec 8 expiry Limit Price: 50 cents Profit target: If XLE is trading at $84 or above on expiration date, this trade will generate a 100% return on investment on the amount risked. Managing losses: An important part of any profitable trading system is that it needs to have positive expectancy. That means the winners need to add up to more than the losers. For me to create positive expectancy with this trading strategy, I will close this trade if I lose 50% of my investment (i.e. 25 cents). By doing this, every winner will cancel out two losing trades.

        "content": "We're selling 250 shares of Foot Locker (FL) at roughly $23 each. Following Friday's trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 750 shares of FL, decreasing its weighting to 0.62% from 0.82%. Markets were having another strong session Friday as bond yields continued to plunge — this time in reaction to the October nonfarm payrolls report , which was softer than expected on job gains and wage growth, which provided more of a reason for the Federal Reserve to end its interest rate hiking cycle. Friday's rally puts the S & P 500 on pace for a roughly 5% weekly gain, with higher sessions every day this week. Whenever there's a sharp, violent rebound higher like this in such a short period of time, it's prudent to find something to trim and replenish cash. After all, we were slow, steady buyers when the market was falling in quick fashion over the past few weeks. It's not always easy emotionally, but the object here is to buy low and sell high. From a portfolio management perspective, we're taking advantage of this broader market strength to sell a \"loser\" position, even if it comes with a steep realized loss. While always tempting to lock in gains, we are reminded of the adage that if you were to only sell winners in your portfolio, you would be stuck holding on to a bunch of losers. So with that being said, we're trimming our position in Foot Locker . FL YTD mountain Foot Locker YTD Back in August, the stock fell from $23.20 per share to $16.64 in a single session in reaction to a terrible second-quarter and outlook cut . Inventory challenges and weakness from its low-income customers plagued the company, putting a dent in the ambitious turnaround plan of CEO Mary Dillion. But here's the thing. Ever since that nightmare quarter, Foot Locker shares have been grinding ever higher. Thanks to Friday's nearly 5% jump, the stock has recovered nearly all the losses from that post-earnings selloff. While bouncing from much lower levels, that's a nearly 40% recovery in a little over two month's time. The move has been encouraging to see and it offers a lesson about not being emotional in the face of a nasty decline, but it's also been puzzling to us because the rally has come without a significant data point that would lead us to believe its customers are feeling better about their finances or the inventory is moving faster than expected. To protect against the risk of yet another shortfall and giving back this rally, we're trimming our Foot Locker position and taking a loss of about 40% on stock we purchased in March. We'll look to reallocate this cash into other positions that we think have stronger fundamental setups in the quarters ahead. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long FL.

        "content": "Microsoft 's (MSFT) new AI assistant tool should help the software giant solidify its lead among its Big Tech peers in the race to dominate artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, Microsoft started officially selling 365 Copilot , an AI add-on for its suite of Office applications used by businesses. The tool, which was first announced in March, integrates generative AI into core productivity apps like Word and Excel for a monthly cost of $30 per person. The assistant tool can help users prepare Word documents and PowerPoint presentations, rank and sort emails, analyze spreadsheet data, and summarize meetings. \"It's certainly an incremental positive near-term and stands to be more material longer term. We'll see how fast adoption takes place, but you could certainly see a snowball effect,\" said Zev Fima, a portfolio analyst at the Investing Club. He added: \"From a skills perspective, this should allow less-advanced workers to close the gap faster and allow more-experienced ones to be more productive and potentially less error prone.\" MSFT YTD mountain Microsoft (MSFT) year-to-date performance Copilot is Microsoft's latest in a series of moves over the last year to integrate AI into its offerings. Earlier in the year, Microsoft launched a new version of its Bing search engine that incorporates technology stemming from OpenAI's ChatGPT. Microsoft has invested roughly $13 billion in startup OpenAI. ChatGPT's large language models are also at the core of Copilot. And Wednesday's general launch of the AI assistant tool should set the stage for the company to develop yet another recurring revenue stream, shoring up sales amid its ongoing investments in AI. Microsoft last week delivered stellar fiscal first-quarter results that demonstrated the firm's AI prowess, in its biggest earnings beat in over two years. During the the company's post-earnings conference call last Tuesday, CEO Satya Nadella said he was already seeing strong engagement with the Copilot tool, with around 40% of Fortune 100 companies using the product as part of an invitation-only, early-access program. \"Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it,\" Nadella said. Wall Street is optimistic, too. Piper Sandler on Sunday said that Microsoft could be having its \"iPhone moment,\" comparing Copilot's rollout to Apple's (AAPL) iPhone launch in 2007. Analysts at the firm forecasted that the AI tool could generate more than $10 billion in annualized revenue for the company by 2026. Microsoft stock, up more than 43% year-to-date, rose 1.89% Wednesday afternoon, to trade at $344.50 a share. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long MSFT, AAPL.

        "description": "Dollar General (DG) has been stuck in a bear trend since November 2022.",
        "content": "A bearish bet on Dollar General using Options Spreads Dollar General (DG) has been stuck in a bear trend since November 2022. In the six month daily chart shown below, we can see that the 50-day simple moving average has been acting as an area of strong resistance. Every time the stock approaches this level, it gets rejected. The 50-day average as of today is currently around $120. And although DG has experienced some upward momentum since mid-October, this upward momentum is now facing resistance once again at the 50-day average. To provide further confirmation for a bearish bias, I am using 2 technical indicators in the chart below: RSI (Relative Strength Index): You will notice that RSI was rising from 10/12 to 10/26 as DG was experiencing a short-term rally. Starting on 10/26, RSI has changed direction and is pointing down, indicating that the stock is losing its upward momentum. DMI (Directional Movement Index): a) When the DI+ (green line) is above DI- (red line), the stock is in an uptrend. However, when the DI lines start changing direction, it indicates a possible change in the current trend. b.) ADX (blue line) measures the strength of the current trend. If you look at ADX, it is pointing downwards indicating the current trend in place (uptrend as indicated by DI+ being above DI-) is weakening. This further provides confirmation to form a bearish bias on DG The Trade Setup: A Bear Put Spread Now that I have a directional bias in place, all I need to do is find a trade structure which will allow me to bet on a downward move in DG. The trade structure I am going to use here is called a \"bear put spread\" also known as a \"put debit spread.\" If you look at DG's option chain, you will notice that this is a highly liquid stock with $1 wide strikes. This is great, because you can construct a $1 wide put spread and risk as little as $50 to make $50 per winning trade. To increase risk, simply add more contracts. Eg. Doing a 50 contract trade would risk $2500 to make $2500. All I need is for DG to drop by $1 by expiration date for this trade to be profitable. Here is the exact trade setup: Buy $120 put Nov 17 expiry Sell $119 put Nov 17 expiry A nice thing about buying ATM (at-the-money) spreads, is that the math becomes very easy. ATM spreads can usually be bought for ½ of the width of the strikes. Since the width of our spread is $120 – $119 = $1, I can buy the spread for .50c. DG YTD mountain Dollar General, YTD If DG is trading at 119 or below on expiration date, this trade will double my money. Managing losses A very important part of any profitable trading system is that it needs to have positive expectancy. That means the winners need to add up to more than the losers. For me, to create positive expectancy with this trading strategy, I will close this trade if I lose 50% of my investment (i.e. 25c). By simply doing this, every winner will cancel out two losing trades.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) stock is poised for fresh gains once the market realizes the iPhone maker's long-term growth prospects in China and the bullish implications of its forthcoming mixed-reality headset. Bank of America on Tuesday called out 'promising' revenue figures from Apple's business in China, while Jim Cramer also highlighted the upcoming launch of Apple's highly anticipated Vision Pro headset at the start of next year. 'I think Apple is about to have the next leg up,' Jim said earlier Tuesday, citing both the headset launch and upbeat data out of China. AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date performance Apple's app store revenue in China increased 10% year-over-year in October following a 10% annual gain the month prior, according to Bank of America, which cited data from SensorTower. The U.S. and China comprised the two biggest app store markets for the company, at 58% of total app revenue. Tuesday's research note follows a slate of negative press around Apple's standing in the world's second-largest economy. Most notably, in September, The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing had banned government employees from using iPhones and other foreign-branded devices at work — fueling a massive selloff of Apple stock. Chinese authorities have since denied the report, with the stock paring some of its losses. Shares of Apple are still up roughly 40% year-to-date. 'Given the recent media reports on a ban of iPhones at [government] locations in China, the strong September & October app store data is promising for Apple,' Bank of America analysts wrote in a note Tuesday. The firm cited positive catalysts that include 'new product introduction and stable iPhones.' Still, the analysts warned that those positives could be offset 'by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment.' But we see the data as a further sign that Apple remains an aspirational brand for Chinese consumers. Its closed ecosystem, product quality and pricing set it apart from peers like China's Huawei. China accounts for roughly 19% of Apple's total revenues. Though, the company has also been investing heavily in India to grab market share in the world's most-populous nation and diversify its supply chain away from China. At the same time, the Vision Pro launch should provide Apple with another catalyst. The high-quality product — tested personally by Jim in July — will help further diversify Apple's revenue streams, giving it an edge over many of its Big Tech competitors. The company said the headset will be available starting around $3,500 from early next year. 'People don't realize that [the Vision Pro] is a [business-to-business] situation,' Jim said on Tuesday.

        "content": "Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped Wednesday after the U.S. government gave the green light for the company's blockbuster GLP-1 drug to be used as an obesity treatment. But the stock's next big catalyst could likely come after a key competitor releases fresh trial data this weekend. In a widely expected move, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved Eli Lilly's GLP-1 drug for weight loss. The active ingredient in the drug, tirzepatide, was approved to treat Type 2 diabetes under the name Mounjaro in May 2022. Eli Lilly said it will market the drug as an obesity treatment under the name Zepbound. Shares of Eli Lilly — which have climbed more than 67% year-to-date — soared nearly 2% Wednesday afternoon, to $611.36 apiece. But the bigger news for investors may come at an American Heart Association meeting on Saturday. Eli Lilly's chief rival, Novo Nordisk (NVO), is set to present the full results from a study that examined whether its GLP-1 weight-loss therapy can also reduce the risk of significant heart problems. Top-line data released in August exceeded expectations, showing patients on the drug had a 20% lower risk for major cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes compared with a placebo group. \"I expect that Monday when we come in, [Eli Lilly] stock might be substantially higher,\" as investors digest Novo Nordisk's presentation, Jim Cramer predicted Wednesday. That would be similar to what occurred in August, when shares of both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly soared in response to the initial data announcement . The two companies dominate the fast-growing market for GLP-1 drugs, which are currently approved to treat Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 is marketed as a weight-loss drug under the name Wegovy, which was approved by the FDA in June 2021 , and as a diabetes treatment under the name Ozempic. GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone in the gut that, when released, reduces appetite. The drugs also help control blood sugar levels. Investors are focused on the data showing that Wegovy reduces the risk of strokes and heart attacks because it helps bolster the case for health insurers to provide reimbursement for the obesity drug and others like it. Broad insurance coverage is necessary for GLP-1 drugs to reach Wall Street's lofty sales projections, which s ome analysts see exceeding $100 billion down the road. While we don't own Novo Nordisk, Jim stressed that the Danish drugmaker's upcoming presentation \"does matter tremendously\" for our investment in Eli Lilly. \"I want people to be up on it and realize this is the next level for what I think will be the biggest selling drug of all time,\" Jim said, referring to the expected sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound.

        "description": "Despite all of that sounding quite bleak for energy and oil, I believe there is opportunity in Exxon Mobil.",
        "content": "West Texas Intermediate futures have dropped precipitously since September, when prices screamed above $93 per barrel. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) has pulled back nearly 10%, as the 25-names making up the fund are sensitive — and often correlated — to moves in crude. Oil prices fell more than 4% on Tuesday to their lowest since late July, as mixed Chinese economic data and rising OPEC exports eased fears about tight markets. To boot, the dollar strengthened, giving bears more ammunition to pounce on crude oil bulls. My friend Brian Sullivan has been on his \"A game\" per usual and speaking to the \"not booming\" global demand. @CL.1 YTD mountain WTI in 2023 Despite all of that sounding quite bleak for energy and oil, I believe there is opportunity in Exxon Mobil . Exxon is the world's largest refiner with a total global oil refining capacity of nearly 5 million barrels per day. Moreover, I think this 2023 laggard has priced in the fact that China importing of oil has been flat year to date (thank you Sully for the insight.) With relative strength index readings in the low 30s — and with Exxon spending nearly the last two months under both its 50 and 200-day moving averages — opportunity knocks to own this integrated oil and gas company giant. In addition, we have seen volatility pick up specifically on the Cboe Crude Oil Volatility index (OVX) . I want to own this stock at this level but, by using a risk reversal, I will utilize the premium I can collect from selling a put option to buy an upside call with the expectation that XOM can revisit its recent price of $120. The option strategy that I will utilize is a credit spread, better known as a risk reversal. This spread can be established by selling an out-of-the-money put and using the premium collected in writing that put option to buy an upside OTM call. The same expiration will be used for both the put and the call options. Here's a look at the risk reversal specific to Exxon Mobil: Looking to sell the regular expiration December $100 put for $1.70 (which is 4% lower from 10/19/23 close) Looking to buy the regular expiration December $110 call for $0.80 The result in the sale of the put and the purchase of the call results in a credit spread collecting $0.90 (or $90 per one lot) Typically, a risk reversal is a hedging strategy that protects a long or short position by using put and call options simultaneously. This strategy can protect against unfavorable price movements in the underlying position but also limits the profits that can be made on that position. If an investor is long a stock, they could create a short risk reversal to hedge their position by buying a put option and selling a call option. This risk reversal is being used as an aggressive bull trade. Since I am buying a higher strike price call option and financing the premium paid by selling an out-of-the-money put option, I am essentially putting on a bull trade for close to no cost or even a credit. If I am correct, and XOM continues to recover higher, the short put will become worthless, and the long call will increase in value-generating a considerable profit. However, if I am incorrect about Exxon's movement, I will be forced to buy the stock at the short put strike price minus the premium collected. In this case, I would own Exxon Mobil at $99.10 as I collected $0.90 on the credit spread/risk reversal. This strategy is considered risky and can generate significant losses, all short puts should be cash covered. Being forced to buy Exxon Mobil lower than where I initially opened the risk reversal is still a better outcome than if I would have simply purchased the stock outright.

Barclays on Monday raised its price target on Starbucks to $123 a share, up from $116, while maintaining an overweight rating on the stock. The call came after analysts at the bank met with Starbucks executives, who reportedly painted a bullish picture looking out to fiscal year 2024. \"Ongoing investment in both wages [and] equipment has allowed for stores to become more productive while also helping to improve the employment experience for customers,\" Barclays analysts wrote in a research note to clients. Indeed, Starbucks subsequently said Monday it plans to raise hourly wages for its U.S. retail workers, or partners, by at least 3% from the start of next year. \"With significant ongoing investments of more than $1 billion since last year to uplift the overall partner and store experience, the company has seen a positive shift in hourly turnover rates, which are now below pre-pandemic levels,\" Starbucks said in a statement Monday. The move is part of the company's \"Triple Shot Reinvention Plan,\" which is being spearheaded by recently appointed CEO Laxman Narasimhan. The plan includes more than $1 billion of investments in employee wage increases, new store equipment to accelerate order flow, digital innovation, and supply chain improvements in fiscal 2024, according to the company. \"The focus of the reinvention plan was to elevate the experience in our stores for our partners and through our partners for our customers,\" Narasimhan said during a presentation for investors last Thursday. Those comments came on the heels of Starbucks delivering an upside surprise for its fiscal fourth quarter that included strong comparable-store sales growth and excellent margin expansion. The results restored our confidence in Starbucks' ability to reach its long-term targets, including in China, which remains a key growth market for the coffee chain. \"I think Starbucks is now a leader because it has one thing going for it: It has a new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan,\" Jim Cramer said Monday. \"This is a guy who's a consumer products guy, who really understands tech,\" he added. SBUX YTD mountain SBUX year-to-date performance. Meanwhile, Wedbush on Monday also raised its price target on Starbucks, to $106 a share, up from $100, while reiterating a neutral rating on the stock. RBC Capital raised its price target to $111 a share, up from $99, with a sector perform rating. And Citi on Sunday took its price target to $110 a share, up from $100, maintaining a neutral rating on the stock. Since the coffee giant reported last Thursday before the opening bell, shares have surged more than 13%, to trade around $103.80 apiece. Following the results, we reiterated a 1 rating on the stock, meaning we would be buyers at current levels. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long SBUX. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

        "description": "Amazon's (AMZN) new health-care add-on to Prime is the latest example of how the subscription is a valuable deal for its members.",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) said on Wednesday that it's offering Prime members a discount on its new health-care service — another perk that should help bring more people into the online retailer's ecosystem. The One Medical service, which typically costs $199 annually, will be available to Prime subscribers for $9 a month or $99 per year. It provides members unlimited 24/7 access to virtual care as well as in-person, and remote primary care services. Prime members can add up to five people from their family to the One Medical plan for an additional $6 a month. Amazon bought One Medical in July 2022. \"Anything that boosts the value of a Prime subscription – which is already one of the great bang for your buck services out there – should be positive Amazon over the long run,\" said Jeff Marks, the Club's director of portfolio analysts. \"The One Medical addition won't move the needle today, but Amazon's business model is built on attracting people into its Prime ecosystem and offering quality products and services at competitive prices, making today's announcement incremental,\" he explained. To be sure, we are not highly focused on the company's health-care initiatives just yet. Rather, the Club is more concerned with Amazon's cloud revenue growth stabilization and how management is unlocking efficiencies in its retail fulfillment network. It's also still early days for Amazon in health care. Before acquiring One Medical, the e-commerce and cloud giant bought medtech startup Health Navigator in October 2019 and online pharmacy Pillpack in September 2018. This is a \"step in the right direction\" for Amazon advancing its efforts in health care, said Tom Forte, analyst at D.A. Davidson. Although Forte mentioned, it might be more difficult to penetrate because the industry is highly regulated. From a company strategy standpoint, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is \"focusing Amazon as a service,\" Forte explained, rather than just a first-party retail play, given the higher services margin profile. A growth part of the company's services business, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, has slowed recently but \"that's somewhat a reflection of the economy,\" the D.A. Davidson said. \"Amazon already has a substantial business in health care today and it also shows its strategic priority for Amazon under Jassy,\" Forte said, pointing to Amazon Pharmacy, One Medical, and the cloud computing customers it has in the health care space. \"Health care has the potential to be very meaningful for Amazon given it's a large total addressable market.\" In a D.A. Davidson August 2023 white paper, analysts said there's \"a greater than 10% chance Amazon can generate an incremental 100 basis points of revenue growth in 2026 by exploiting health care\" through Amazon Pharmacy and AWS sales it generates from health care companies. Amazon offering a discounted subscription to One Medical's services is part of the company's efforts to expand the broader Prime flywheel by leveraging its 167 million Prime members. The goal of the Amazon Prime membership is to provide people with \"one simple membership, something that provides shopping, savings, streaming and now positive health outcomes, said Jamil Ghani, SVP of Amazon Prime in a CNBC interview Wednesday.

        "description": "Profit takers pushed the stock lower 3% in extended trading after Apple signaled the company may not return to growth in the holiday quarter.",
        "content": "Apple topped expectations in its earnings report release Thursday afternoon in the face of its fourth consecutive quarter of declining revenue as an uncertain macroeconomic outlook questions global consumer demand for their products. Profit takers pushed the stock lower 3% in extended trading after Apple signaled the company may not return to growth in the holiday quarter. Apple has kept up with the Nasdaq 100's outperforming year and continues to deliver alpha per the 3 year look back. Apple was by far the most profitable American company last year, with its $99.8 billion in net income, about 38% higher than the next most profitable firm listed on the S & P 500, Microsoft. The tech giant reported $383.29 billion in sales for the full fiscal year, down about 3% from the prior year. Quarterly revenue declined less than 1% in the September quarter. The results suggest that Apple is facing a deceleration in China. The government there has imposed bans on U.S. technology in some workplaces. However, Apple's services business was a bright spot. Apple recorded $22.31 billion in services revenue, outpacing analyst expectations and increasing more than 16% from a year earlier. As Apple attempts to pull out of its longest sales slowdown in decades, I remain optimistic on its 2023 trajectory as the stock is up nearly 40% year-to-date but, I realize that Apple is enduring short-term growth issues. As I approach a strategy, I want to define my risk but also express my view that Apple may move higher from here, but the Magnificent Seven and original tech darling may struggle in reclaiming its $3 trillion market cap by year's end. Selling a call spread will help me in capturing my view as long as Apple does not move up more than 10% from here. After U.S. job growth slowed sharply in October, markets may finish out the week on a continued high note as the new month of November has caught some underinvested, money managers on the sideline. (S & P 500 is +3% since the start of the month.) A bear call Spread The option strategy that I will utilize is selling a call spread better known as a bear call spread . This credit spread can be established by selling an out-of-the-money call and using the premium collected in writing that call option to buy a further OTM call. The same expiration will be used for both call options. I am leaning on previous 2023 price action and the chart technicals to assist in selecting the strike prices for this call spread. AAPL YTD mountain Apple, YTD A bear call spread is a two-part options strategy that involves selling a call option and collecting option premium upfront, and then simultaneously buying a second call option with the same expiration date yet at a higher strike price. Since the strike of the call sold (the short call leg) is lower than the strike for the call purchased (the long call leg), the amount of option premium collected in the first leg is always greater than the cost paid in the second leg creating a credit spread scenario. Selling a call spread in APPL: Looking to sell the regular expiration December $180 call for $2.90 (which is roughly 10% higher from 11/02/23 close) Looking to buy the regular expiration December $190 call for $0.60 The result in the sale of the call and the purchase of the higher strike call results in a credit spread collecting $2.30 ($230 will be collected per one spread sold) The max loss is $7.70 on this call spread if Apple settles back above $190 where it was trading in July 2023. This call spread allows a trader to capture premium while also not believing that the stock will rise more than 10% and the max loss is capped at $770. If you believe that Apple will vault back above $190 and finish 2023 on an even stronger note, feel free to take the other side of this trade.

        "content": "Photo:The American economy is the envy of the Western world. Our country's economy grew by almost 5 percent on an annual basis in the last quarter. The unemployment rate remains at historic lows. The share of prime-age Americans in the workforce is higher than it has been since the 2008 financial crisis. Thanks to an abundance of job opportunities, lower-income workers have recovered about 25 percent of the increase in wage inequality that occurred between the elections of Ronald Reagan and Joe Biden caught up. And for eight months, wages have been rising faster than consumer prices. The European economy, on the other hand, is stagnating. While American GDP is just below its pre-COVID trend, the EU's GDP is 5 percent below its pre-pandemic trend. And yet, despite this slower growth, European consumers face similar inflation rates as their American counterparts. Graphic: Financial Times So Joe Biden's economic management looks objectively strong. The pandemic has imposed real costs on economies across the West. The closure of large parts of the economy and the disruption of fragile supply chains inevitably led to a weakening of countries' productive capacity. Inflation was therefore inevitable unless governments decided to concentrate the costs of economic adjustment on the most vulnerable by tolerating a sustained period of increased unemployment and poverty. However, within the constraints imposed by a world-historical crisis, Biden led the American economy to a superlative recovery. The US experienced stronger growth – without higher inflation costs – than Europe. And as Martin Sandbu of the Financial Times writes, this divergence is largely due to America's superior fiscal policies; that is, to Biden's American Rescue Plan and the Trump-era COVID relief bills. Still, the American public takes an extraordinarily dim view of the Biden economy. In a recent New York Times/Sienna College poll of 2024 battleground states, only 19 percent of voters described the economy as 'good' or 'excellent.' By a margin of 59 percent to 37 percent, these constituencies disapproved of Biden's economic record. Those results are consistent with a Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll in seven swing states that found only 35 percent of voters trust Biden on the economy, with 51 percent saying things were better under Donald Trump. More direct indicators of economic satisfaction—without a direct connection to party politics—tell a similar story. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index has never returned to its pre-pandemic peak and has fallen steadily for four straight months. What explains the dissonance between the objective merits of the Biden economy and the overwhelming dissatisfaction of the electorate? Many staunch Democrats tend to blame the media, the president's clumsy messaging, or the inevitably sour 'mood' of a nation that still hasn't recovered from the traumas of the pandemic. It is plausible that all of these factors influenced public dissatisfaction. But there are also several objective features of Biden-era economic life that could explain voters' antipathy toward the president. Here are three reasons Americans are less happy with Bidenomics: Looked at from one perspective, voters' distaste for Biden's economy doesn't seem so difficult to understand: Although real wages have risen since February, there was an exceptionally long period in the first two years of Biden's presidency in which consumer prices outpaced wage growth. In other words, for most of the Biden era, the purchasing power of U.S. workers has been declining. Graphics: Statista This reversed again in 2023. And real hourly wages for manufacturing and non-managerial workers in the U.S. are now higher than they were before the pandemic. Nevertheless, the price level is significantly higher than in 2019 due to years of rapid inflation. In the long term, the nominal price of consumer goods is likely to be less important than their price in relation to wages. In 1950, a standard television cost $200. These days you could pay around $500 for a mid-range TV. Yet despite that higher sticker price, televisions are now objectively much cheaper, since they account for a much smaller share of the average worker's income. But it hasn't even been a year since inflation stopped growing faster than wage growth. That's why people still find the nominal prices on their grocery bills incredibly high. This reality is borne out by a recent Blueprint/YouGov poll, which found that 64 percent of voters consider lower prices for 'goods, services and gas' to be their top priority, while only 7 percent said the same for 'jobs.' The Biden administration's economic message has understandably placed an emphasis on job creation, as its success on that front is clear. Still, 15 percent of Americans are retired, and the vast majority of U.S. workers have remained steadily employed throughout the pandemic. So the biggest beneficiaries of Biden-era job growth are only a small portion of the public, while all Americans are directly affected by consumer prices. The idea that Biden's first two years in office have poisoned his image as an economic manager is consistent with international political trends. As Matthew Yglesias has noted, almost every head of state in a G-7 country has an abysmal approval rating. Biden's 39 percent score is actually slightly better than Justin Trudeau's, which is at 33 percent. In France, approval of Emmanuel Macron is 26 percent; in Germany, Olaf Scholz is at 25 percent; in Japan, Fumio Kishida is at 22 percent. Significantly, the only G-7 leader with significantly higher marks than Biden is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who took power after the worst of the post-COVID inflation crisis and is therefore not associated with it. Americans' income and savings are not determined solely by wages. Another important factor influencing the finances of private households are government transfer payments. In 2021, the American Rescue Plan's stimulus packages, child tax credit expansion, and enhanced unemployment benefits led to a historic increase in Americans' income and personal savings. However, because these programs were temporary, their impact diminished over the next two years. As a result, Americans experienced a historically unusual decline in their annual income and bank balances in 2022. As Matt Bruenig notes, in a typical year, about 45 percent of people have lower incomes than the year before. But in 2022, that share shot up to around 60 percent, due to both inflation and the expiration of pandemic-era transfer payments. Photo: People's Policy Project Graphic: FRED Of course, Americans' incomes are higher today than they were before the pandemic. And their balance sheets are about as strong. It wouldn't be entirely rational for voters to be upset that their income went down just because they received a $1,400 check in 2021 but not in 2022. Nevertheless, it is plausible that the widespread experience of a decline in income and savings has dampened the mood in the country. Finally, although inflation has cooled in 2023, interest rates have steadily risen to levels not seen in decades. And since much of American consumer spending is financed by debt, higher borrowing costs limit the impact of price declines. Furthermore, the squandering of household savings from the pandemic period is compounding the challenge of high interest rates. With no emergency fund to fall back on, consumers are increasingly relying on credit cards to finance their everyday expenses. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, credit card balances rose 15 percent in the most recent quarter compared to the previous year. The average consumer balance is now at its highest level in 10 years. Meanwhile, credit card interest rates have risen more than 5 percent since the Federal Reserve began hiking rates. As a result, the credit card default rate among American households has reached its highest level since late 2011. At the same time, with mortgage interest rates at 8 percent, their highest in two decades, many Americans feel that one of their most important economic goals – owning a home – is now out of reach. 🚨Cost fatigue: It appears that lower income and younger people are being hit hardest by the current economic landscape where the 'cost of everything' is higher pic.twitter.com/oRdRe0Et2N — Gregory Daco (@GregDaco) November 10, 2023 That is, voters' disapproval of Biden's economic management is plausibly based on objective conditions. But that's not necessarily bad news for the president. If inflation continues to ease, the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates next year, easing some of the pressure on consumers. At the same time, the rise in inflation after the COVID crisis is receding further into the past with each passing day. If the U.S. economy can continue on its current trajectory through Election Day, voters could be more lenient toward Biden in November 2024 than they are today.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\nJosie Gibson.Age: 38\nInstagram: @josiegibson85\nJob: This Morning host\nJosie Gibson rose to fame after winning the 11th season of Big Brother in 2010.\nThe following year, Gibson became a regular guest host on OK! TV on Channel 5 and continued working in TV.\nHer other TV projects include being a reporter on Big Brother's Bit On The Side from August to November 2011, Celebrity Wedding Planner, Loose Women and The Wright Stuff.\nIn 2019, Gibson joined This Morning as a competition announcer and two years later she became a presenter on the show. Following Phillip Schofield's departure from the programme, Gibson began presenting alongside Holly Willoughby.\nPhobias: \"Insects. I freeze every time I see a spider and I am not sure what I am going to do if I a in a trial with them!\"\nBiggest misconception you want to dispel in the jungle: \"I would like people to know I'm very clever knowing useless information!\"\nBest and worst attributes: \"I am an optimist and I love meeting people from all walks of life. Worst? I can be quite nosey and I am worried about my temper if I am too hungry.\"\nDream camper: \"Dawn French, I love her.\"\nWith I'm a Celebrity approaching, the idea of it is just sinking in for Gibson.\nAhead of the show's launch, she said: \"I keep thinking, 'S**t, I am actually going this.' I know I have taken on challenges for This Morning in the past but I don't know if I've taken on too much here. It's all becoming very real.\"\nThe TV host admitted she is \"dreading the insects\" as it is her \"biggest phobia\".\n\"I also don't like spiders and I freeze normally when I see one,\" she said, continuing: \"My family thinks I am mad doing the programme too as they know what I'm like with creepy crawlies!\"\nWhile it may seem bizarre why she chose to take part on the show given her many fears, Gibson said she loves the show so much and that's why she decided to accept the offer to take part.\nRead more:\n\"I am most looking forward to being at one with nature,\" she added. \"And I hope I learn new things about myself. I hope I can push myself more than I think I can. Eating trials? I have got to try and close my eyes and not think about what it is I am eating. Heights? I don't like heights either. To be fair, I am not liking a lot of things that the jungle throws at you but I want to give it all a go.\"\nGibson is looking forward to getting to know the celebrities in the camp, with some she wouldn't normally meet.\nShe said: \"I love it when people sit and tell stories and I hope people won't think I am too nosey but I love chatting to them and finding out about them. I love people from all walks of life.\n\"I don't think I will get too bored as if I am with lots of people, like I will be in camp, then I think we can have a laugh together. It's actually going to be nice being in one spot for a change as I travel a lot.\"\nAs for whether she would want to be crowned Queen of the Jungle, Gibson said her main goal is to try and win as many stars as she can for the camp.\nI'm a Celebrity...

        "description": "With Disney trading around $85 a share, apparently someone is willing to bet the stock could pop well over 10% post-earnings.",
        "content": "We'll touch on Berkshire Hathaway's weekend report, review some interesting companies reporting in the week ahead and then analyze a curious call spread in Disney ahead of earnings. Berkshire reported operating earnings of $10.76 billion on Saturday. The company also reported $157 billion in cash, a new record. The positive way to look at it is that Warren Buffett's businesses are tremendously successful, generate enormous free cash flow and now those cash balances actually earn some interest. A more pessimistic interpretation is that Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger and the rest of the Berkshire investment team are finding short-term treasury yields more appealing than stocks. Here we sit, in the thick of earnings season, should we just \"T-Bill and chill\"? I absolutely believe that some cash ought to be in short-term treasuries. We hold 5% of our long-only event fund in cash at the moment, and for individuals a larger cash position might be appropriate, but most investors will be primarily invested in stocks and real estate, as Berkshire Hathaway is. Looking at the week ahead In any case, while 5% a year risk-free is attractive, we look to equities for better returns than that…usually. After all, the options market is implying that the companies listed in the table below, all of which report earnings this week, could move 5% or more, either higher or lower, by Friday November 10th. We own the names highlighted in green in our event-driven long-only strategy, and I actually like some of the other names that will be reporting, but find it a bit difficult to chase them here as several are already up so much this year. For example, Celsius , which is very intriguing beverage company growing at 100% per year, is up nearly 68% as I write this year-to-date and trading at a sky-high multiple. Hubspot is growing topline in the mid 25-27% year-over-year, but also, trading at 10 times revenues so it isn't cheap either. I rather like MGM Resorts at 16.5 times full-year EPS estimates, and with it up 13.8% year-to-date, it doesn't feel like it has gotten out of reach. So why don't we own it? Our options market sentiment analysis score is in 75th percentile in terms of risk-adjusted expected returns. Not abysmal, but not good/high conviction enough for us to sell another holding to buy it. Uber is another name that, up more than 90% year-to-date is tough to chase. Notice though that we own Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) , which is down 26% from the January high. Our thinking, and the options sentiment suggested, that earnings might be the catalyst for a turnaround. Our basis is less than $10/share, so far so good. The Disney trade So how about Disney then? At just over 17 times, it's trading at less than a market multiple. Although the company is still sorting out the changing landscape in streaming, parks have been doing well and ESPN has always been one of the most valuable media properties. It seems at least one institutional options trader thinks that earnings might be the catalyst for an upside move in the name. Disney reports Wednesday after the bell. We saw substantial purchases of the November $95/$100 call spread on Friday, including a single trade of 5,562 contracts (details in the chart above). This call spread entails buying the $95 call and selling the $100 call. With Disney trading around $85 a share, apparently someone is willing to bet a small percentage of the current stock price that the stock could pop well over 10% post-earnings — something that hasn't happened since their August 2022 earnings release. Personally, I'd prefer lower strikes and a bit more time to expiration, both of which would yield a higher probability of profit, but the flip side is those changes would reduce the lottery-ticket like payout in the event DIS rallies well through the $95 strike.

        "description": "Oracle's (ORCL) new cloud-computing agreement with Microsoft demonstrates the wisdom of the former's AI strategy.",
        "content": "Oracle 's (ORCL) new cloud-computing agreement with Microsoft demonstrates the wisdom of the former's AI strategy – and reinforces our view that the stock is a buy at current levels. Oracle announced this week that Microsoft (MSFT) has tapped Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to help meet its computing-power needs amid booming demand for its AI services , specifically search engine Bing. The multi-year deal will ultimately give Microsoft access to more of Nvidia 's (NVDA) cutting-edge AI chips, which have been in short supply since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT last year intensified investments in AI technology. Nvidia is the world's dominant AI chipmaker, and its processors are housed in data centers operated by Oracle, Microsoft and other cloud-computing firms. \"I think [Oracle] is the least expensive of…the hyperscalers and should be bought, particularly because Larry Ellison had the foresight to get as many Nvidia chips as possible,\" Jim Cramer said Thursday. Ellison is Oracle's co-founder, chairman and chief technology officer. Safra Catz is Oracle's CEO. Shares of Oracle have climbed more than 6% since the start of October, but are still down more than 10% from where the stock closed Sept. 11, before its fiscal first-quarter results disappointed investors and sparked a steep sell-off. We've added to our position in Oracle five times since then, arguing the weakness has been misplaced. The most recent buy came on Nov. 1, at roughly $105 per share . Oracle does not develop any of its own AI chips and its shrewd strategy — a key prong to our investment thesis — has been to rely heavily on Nvidia's chips, such as the H100 graphics processing unit. In forging close ties with Nvidia, Oracle has made its cloud-computing operations more competitive relative to larger providers like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOGL). Microsoft has long been a big buyer of Nvidia chips for its own cloud service, Azure, but evidently needs more processing power than what's currently available in-house. Oracle is \"going to get a lot of business in this partnership simply because Microsoft can't get all [the chips] they want,\" Jim said. Oracle and Microsoft have an established relationship. In September, the two companies struck a deal to put Oracle's database hardware inside Microsoft's data centers, a development that Wall Street analysts championed as a \"win-win\" for the Club holdings. At the time, Ellison said the move was designed to hasten cloud adoption and benefit customers of Oracle's well-known database products who use other applications hosted on Azure. The latest Oracle-Microsoft agreement also carries positive implications for Nvidia, further illustrating just how much demand there is for Nvidia's AI chips. Nvidia's long-term growth prospects have faced added uncertainty in recent weeks , after the U.S. government announced tougher restrictions on AI chip exports to China, citing national security concerns. But on Thursday, local media in China and the Financial Times reported that Nvidia has developed a new slate of AI chips for Chinese customers that comply with the latest U.S. restrictions — which, if true, is likely an incremental positive for the company's near-term revenue. Still, Jim cautioned Thursday that he's not been able to confirm those reports with Nvidia directly. \"What does matter to me, though, is there's clearly a shortage of Nvidia chips, and it's so bad that Microsoft has to contract with Larry Ellison, who bought so many of the chips,\" Jim said. \"That is a sign that Oracle may not be as bad as people think.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long ORCL, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN and GOOGL .

        "description": "Two of the semiconductor stocks that reported this week saw some big post-earnings moves and substantially above-average options trading activity.",
        "content": "We often spend the weekend looking ahead to potential market-moving catalysts. What are the major economic releases? Which companies will be reporting earnings? While we don't ignore upcoming events once the trading week is underway, we must also keep an eye on what is trading, and which stocks are actually moving and why. Upcoming events are those we see through the windshield, but one must also look side-to-side and check one's mirrors too. Two of the semiconductor stocks that reported this week saw some big post-earnings moves and substantially above-average options trading activity. Among the biggest winners were Wolfspeed Inc. (WOLF) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) . AMD WOLF 5D mountain AMD vs Wolfspeed, 5 days Are options markets aligned with these spikes or fading them using them as opportunities to initiate new bearish positions? Betting against Wolfspeed Wolfspeed popped sharply after a modest topline beat. Wolfspeed \"is a global leader in Silicon Carbide technology and RF semiconductors\" that supplies the EV industry as well as telecom, military and aerospace. As the global automotive fleet transitions to EVs, the company would appear to have a meaningful secular tailwind, something management appeared to support describing \"very, very heavy demand\". Additionally, some issues building capacity appear to be largely resolved, and they describe their wafers as as \"the best\" in the industry. Did options traders jump on the mild beat and positive comments to place bullish bets? Well, not exactly. While there was some short-dated call buying, essentially playing for a little follow-through, some of the longer dated activity was bearish. For example, the January 2025 $17.50 puts saw some opening buying activity, and although those have a long time to go until expiration they're 44% out-of-the-money to the downside. So despite the upbeat commentary and forecast from management, and the positive move in the stock price, some options traders believe the downtrend that began in December 2021 could resume. Several analysts were also unimpressed with the results, JPMorgan, Roth MKM, Canaccord Genuity, Morgan Stanley, Citi and Deutsche Bank all reduced their price targets. With negative cash flow forecast for the foreseeable future, the company will need to take on even more debt (they currently have 5.2B in debt) - a more daunting and expensive exercise these days. The put purchase suggests that some traders believe the company may find itself in a cash/credit crunch despite the growth. AMD also popped sharply after and options volumes exploded. At almost 30 times forward earnings, AMD isn't a cheap stock, and the $5.8 billion in revenues the company reported for the quarter represented only 4.2% year-over-year growth. Betting on AMD Unlike WOLF, AMD was up over 50% year-to-date going into the print so the pop wasn't a short-covering rally. Instead, the story for AMD was all about AI. Management pointed out that AI will not see only one winner, referring to Nvidia (NVDA) and projected 2024 revenue associated with the data center GPU business. Remember that GPUs are the higher margin product generally associated with AI versus CPUs, although GPUs are used in gaming, supercomputing, and graphics intensive workflows like videoediting, and it was in GPUs that AMD discussed 2024 revenue potentially exceeding $2 billion. Additionally, AMD will be launching their MI300 series GPUs December 6th, another potential catalyst to move the stock. At least one options trader believes that the stock's surge could be sustained through that event, purchasing 3,000 AMD December $110 calls paying $5.95/contract. The buyer of these calls is risking just under 6% of the current stock price to make a bullish bet that AMD could rally as much as 7.5% or more over the next 6 weeks. Two semis, both offering products critical to big secular trends, but only one of these, AMD, has net cash on the balance sheet and substantial free cash flow in the forecast. Thirty times earnings isn't cheap in this environment admittedly, but then good businesses rarely are.

        "description": "Our trades and decisions on stock ratings were driven more by earnings, company-specific developments and portfolio management.",
        "content": "What a difference a week makes. Following last week's stumbles, the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all tracking to go wire-to-wire this week, with five-straight days of gains. Dovish rhetoric from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a Goldilocks (not too hot, not too cold) jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department on Friday pulled bond yields lower, which supported stocks. On Monday and Tuesday, the market had a hangover from last week and was still oversold, according to the S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator . But we could see the tide was turning. After seven straight sessions in oversold territory, the Oscillator flipped to neutral after the close Wednesday and remained there heading into Friday's session. Our trades and decisions on stock ratings were driven more by earnings, company-specific developments and portfolio management rather than any broad commentary on the market. Tuesday We downgraded Ford Motor (F) to a 2 rating because the post-earnings decline in the stock was not a selloff that we were interested in buying . Last week, Ford delivered an earnings miss due to lower volumes and a $1.2 billion increase in warranty expenses. Also troubling: Ford's bumpy transition to electric vehicles and impending higher labor costs that the United Auto Workers union extracted during its six-week strike. Wednesday We bought 75 more shares of GE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC), the day after the medical equipment maker reported strong third-quarter results , including solid margin expansion. The stock soared more than 5% on the news, adding to those gains throughout the rest of the week. However, GEHC shares are still down significantly from April's year-to-date high and down big even from mini-rallies in June and July. We bought 50 more shares of Oracle (ORCL) because recent cloud-industry commentary bodes well for the company. Oracle reports earnings next week. This was the second week in which we added to our Oracle position, buying up shares on Oct. 23 after an unwarranted selloff following management's remarks at the company's AI Executive Forum event. We also downgraded Estee Lauder (EL) to a 4 rating and removed our price target on the stock after a shockingly bad quarter. We knew things were not going to be good. However, the luxury beauty company's warning on forward guidance called into question management's credibility. Estee Lauder's new \"Profit Recovery Plan\" provided little comfort because it's not expected to kick in until the company's fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Thursday We exited our smallest position, Veralto (VLTO) — selling all the shares we received when the water quality was spun off last month from Club name Danaher (DHR). Veralto is currently experiencing headwinds, including weakness in China. Moreover, Club name DuPont de Nemours (DD) has a similar water business. So, we intend to consolidate the water-quality risk and buy more DuPont when our trading restrictions allow. But water is not why we own DuPont, whose electronics and industrial business is on the cusp of a recovery. The specialty chemicals giant makes materials and coatings for the industry. Friday We sold 250 shares of Foot Locker (FL), taking a tough loss to avoid giving back a nearly 40% recovery in the stock over the past two months. You can't only sell winners for a profit. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet and sell losers to mitigate risk. That's exactly what we did with Foot Locker, which has been a terrible stock. We'll look to reallocate this cash into other positions that we think have stronger fundamental setups in the quarters ahead. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long F, GEHC, ORCL, EL, DHR, DD, FL.

        "content": "When TJX Companies (TJX) reports quarterly results this week, we expect the off-price retailer to demonstrate continued momentum on both its top and bottom lines, helped by consumers looking for solid deals in an uncertain economic environment. TJX — which operates discount department stores T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods — is set to release results for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2024 on Wednesday before the opening bell. And we're confident management can deliver a further expansion of gross margins as wary American consumers look for value at TJX's popular off-price chains. For the three months ended Oct. 28, TJX's total revenue is expected to climb 7.4% year-over-year, to $13.07 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by LSEG. Earnings-per-share (EPS) should come in at 99 cents, LSEG data showed, up 15% on an annual basis. TJX's results come as U.S. consumers face a higher interest-rate environment — making credit more expensive — and ongoing, if easing, inflation. But the company's business model makes it uniquely positioned to weather those challenges and attract fresh customers — allowing it to opportunistically buy up designer wares from prior seasons and sell that merchandise at a discount. Increased consumer traffic Over the past year, TJX has been attracting more customers to its stores, as evidenced by higher ticket transactions — an important indicator of higher comparable-store sales growth. \"Traffic remains the primary driver for comp in off-price,\" Barclays said in a recent research note previewing earnings for TJX and peers Ross Stores (ROSS) and Burlington Stores (BURL). Barclays, which says the off-price sector is in a \"golden moment,\" expects TJX to have captured increased wallet share from existing customers last quarter, as well as new customers from a higher-income cohort. \"Our data checks support evidence of trade-down from higher-income consumers into the off-price channel, with the most notable trade-down at TJX and ROST,\" analysts at Barclays wrote. The firm predicts mid-to-high single-digit comparable-sales growth at the Marmaxx division — which includes both T.J. Maxx and Marshalls — and low-to-mid single-digit growth at HomeGoods. Merchandise opportunities TJX has been able to sell high-quality merchandise, as many cash-strapped mainstream retailers have been forced to sell excess brand-name and designer inventory. Indeed, traffic at TJX's stores has been driven by a \"very compelling\" assortment of goods, Dana Telsey, CEO and chief research officer of Telsey Advisory Group, told CNBC. And in a recent research note, Telsey's firm noted that TJX \"continues to make progress on inventories supported by strong demand and a favorable off-price buying environment.\" When TJX last reported in August, management said \"the marketplace is loaded with outstanding buying opportunities\" and that it's confident it can \"continue to offer a terrific mix of brands and an outstanding assortment of gifts to our shoppers during the fall and holiday selling seasons.\" Higher profits In addition to delivering higher sales, TJX continues to show improved profitability — a trend we expect to accelerate when the company reports on Wednesday. Telsey expects TJX's continued gross-margin benefit seen in the first half of the year to have been a tailwind through its fiscal third quarter. She sees at least 120 basis points of gross-margin leverage, but added that figure \"could be higher, mainly driven by lower freight costs and the benefit and leverage they get from top line sales growth.\" At the same time, according to Telsey, TJX faces headwinds from incremental store wage and payroll costs. But \"given the increased traffic, they're able to offset that,\" she argued. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long TJX. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

We will only consider more general questions about the investment process or stocks in the portfolio or related industries. This week's question: What is the full position of the stocks in the portfolio? How do we establish that level for ourselves? — Scott L. Great question. It really depends on the investor. We own 30-plus stocks, so we try not to exceed about 5% to 6% in any one position. This ensures that we remain diversified and that no single stock has too much impact on the portfolio. Currently, only Apple (AAPL) has a weighting above 5% (5.6%). We have had to trim our Apple position in the past when it has grown beyond 6%. We don't recommend that members own 30 or more stocks. Our rule of thumb: Do one hour of homework a week on each stock to keep on top of things. That time can add up pretty quickly as you add more stocks. In addition to Jim, who seems to not require sleep, we have two analysts and an entire editorial team doing research. This is how we stay current with each of our holdings. For most members, it makes better sense to identify five to ten stocks across various sectors. Those with more time to dedicate to their portfolio can obviously add more. We will always provide our research and trading decisions for every stock in the portfolio and bullpen. Just try to stay diversified, which means not owning the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). If you own five stocks, a full position could be as much as 20%, depending on the size of your cash position. With ten stocks, the full position could be closer to 10%, assuming an equally weighted portfolio. Of course, even if diversified, those are certainly large positions. Some investors will not be comfortable with so much riding on any singly company. You can also decide on smaller weightings. We always recommend an investor's first $10,000 should go to an S & P 500 index fund. So one option for putting all your money to work without making any one stock position too big is to keep adding to your index fund. For example, you can own 10 stocks with full positions of 5% and allocate the other 50% to the index fund and cash. Or maybe you own five names at 8% each, 15% in cash, and the remaining 45% in an index fund. There are many ways to slice this up. A 'full' position will differ for every investor. What's most important to consider is your comfort level and appetite for risk. The smaller the full position, the less risk any one stock's performance can blow up your portfolio.

        "description": "The strategy is to target companies whose stocks are down in price but whose businesses show promise.",
        "content": "Buying the dip and adding 150 more shares of DuPont (DD) on Monday is indicative of how we're looking to put cash to work in a market that flipped late last week from severely oversold to overbought, according to the S & P Short Range Oscillator . The strategy, which has served us well in past earnings sessions, is to target companies, like a DuPont, whose stocks are down in price but whose businesses show promise. DuPont's decline from last week's mixed quarter screamed buying opportunity to us. So, we acted. As mentioned during Monday's Morning Meeting , three other names that immediately came to mind as possible buys were cybersecurity leader Palo Alto Networks (PANW), health insurer Humana (HUM) and industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT). Here's a look at why we're considering beefing up our positions. PANW YTD mountain Palo Alto Networks YTD Shares of Palo Alto Networks dropped another 4% on Monday, adding to Friday's more than 2.5% decline on Fortinet's disappointing full-year guidance. The warning, which came after the closing bell Thursday, sent Fortinet shares down more than 12% on Friday and pressured anything even remotely related to cybersecurity. Investors were making assumptions about what Fortinet's concerns might mean for Palo Alto. But we've seen this movie before, twice actually. In August , we told members to pick up shares of Palo Alto, which were down then, like now, on comments from Fortinet's management team. Back in May , it wasn't Fortinet but worries after quarterly duds from Tenable (TENB) and Cloudflare (NET) that pressured the group. In both instances, Palo Alto shares were indeed a buying opportunity — because as we learned and believe to still be the case, the pain being felt by its peers is due to their lack of a broad-based cybersecurity ecosystem. Since Palo Alto has built out a broad portfolio able to protect clients at every attack vector, the company has proven to be a winner thus far as clients look to save costs without compromising security by consolidating their spending to one vendor, or a select few. We would bet that this same dynamic plays out again — and as a result, we're looking at this most recent bout of weakness as a buying opportunity. CAT YTD mountain Caterpillar YTD Caterpillar is another recent underperformer we find interesting. Despite rebounding from recent lows, shares were below the level they were trading prior to the company's third-quarter earnings release on Oct. 31. We don't think that move is reflecting the strong underlying fundamentals and positive setup into 2024 on the back of continued infrastructure spending by the U.S. government. While the backlog declined a bit as of the end of Q3, we're reiterating that this was expected and not concerning because it was a function of an improving supply chain, not a deterioration of end market demand. Against the backlog decline, we saw an increase in dealer inventories. Dealers are independent businesses and are unlikely to increase inventory levels unless they see strong demand continuing. HUM YTD mountain Humana YTD Humana is another name whose stock price action simply does not reflect the fundamentals we saw in the company's most recent earnings report , out last Wednesday. Humana reported better-than-expected sales and earnings. However, the benefits expense ratio (also known as the medical loss ratio or MLR) in the key insurance segment was greater than expected, weighing on shares for the rest of the week. That's certainly not ideal, but we have to remember that you don't get buying opportunities when results are ideal. You get them when a little bit of bad news – such as an elevated MLR outlook – dings a company with an otherwise strong outlook. With Humana shares roughly 7% since reporting earnings compared to the S & P 500's over 4% gain during the same stretch, we think the stock has been beaten down more than enough to reflect any disappointment. Additionally, at 15.3 times 2024 earnings estimates (below their 5-year average of 17.5 times), we think shares can be bought at current levels.

        "description": "Emerson Electric's disappointing quarterly results highlighted management's inability to execute on a consistent basis, forcing us to downgrade the stock.",
        "content": "Industrial technology company Emerson Electric 's (EMR) disappointing quarterly results Wednesday highlighted management's inability to execute on a consistent basis, forcing us to downgrade our rating on the stock and lower our price target. Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 increased 5% year-over-year, to $4.09 billion, but missed analysts' forecasts of $4.19 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) jumped 21% on an annual basis, to $1.29, while falling short of expectations of $1.31 per share. Emerson stock tumbled 7.7% Tuesday, to trade around $84.60 a share. Bottom line This was not the fiscal fourth quarter we were looking for. We had wanted to see consistency following two strong quarters that came after a rocky start to the year, but Emerson Electric didn't deliver. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) and cash flow were bright spots, while the company's backlog – a leading indicator of sales – did increase 12% year-over-year. But that was all over shadowed by misses on sales, weak underlying growth, and a suboptimal outlook for the current quarter and fiscal year 2024. For the current quarter, the sales forecast was solid, even as the earnings guidance came up short. On a full-year basis, sales and earnings forecasts fell short of expectations, as did cash-flow-generation targets. For fiscal 2024, the company said its \"process and hybrid end markets remain strong, driven by secular trends like energy security, sustainability and decarbonization, nearshoring and digital transformation.\" But management also said Tuesday that discrete markets are at a different stage in the business cycle, noting that orders remain under pressure and aren't expected to rebound until the back half of fiscal 2024. Given the lack of consistency from management and disappointing outlook we are cutting our price target to $100 a share, down from $110, representing 19-times the company's five-year historical average. We are also downgrading shares to a 3 rating , meaning we would sell into strength and potentially look to exit our position. In short, there are better places in which to put money to work as we look to the new year, those with management teams that execute on a consistent basis. Companywide results Overall sales fell short of analysts' estimates and underlying sales growth — excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, and significant acquisitions and divestitures — also came up short versus expectations. Sales at the measurement and analytical subsegment of the intelligent devices unit was the only bright spot. At the same time, EBITA came in belter than expected on the back of roughly 80 basis points of margin expansion, while EPS still came in below Wall Street's estimates. Cash flow was better than expected but not enough to offset the weakness elsewhere. Moreover, guidance was mixed at best — even though Emerson exited its fiscal 2023 with a $6.6 billion backlog, up 12% on the prior year, aided by an acceleration in underlying order growth. Guidance Looking ahead, management's forecast for the current quarter pointed to a better than expected sales result, however its earnings guidance came up short. On a full-year basis, expectations for underlying sales growth and full-year earnings bracketed expectations. But the outlook wasn't quite what the Street had predicted, with underlying sales growth and earnings forecasts missing at the midpoint, while sales and cash-flow targets came up short even at the higher end of the provided guidance range. \"Energy transition, industrial software, life sciences and metal and mining are expected to remain resilient parts of our portfolio,\" and though \"discrete markets are down in both our factory automation and test and measurement, we are seeing recovery in the second half of the year,\" CEO Surendralal Karsanbhai said Tuesday. The full-year earnings forecast includes a 35 to 40 cent contribution from the acquisition of National Instruments, though the bulls may have been looking for a bit more.

        "content": "DISH Network (DISH) fell more than 30% following earnings, and is now down more than 90% in just over two years. Options volumes and prices have skyrocketed since, but they're not betting the stock will do the same. The issue? It's cash flow. Subscriber declines of 64,000 in pay TV and 225,000 in their wireless business startled investors. The question investors are asking themselves now is not whether the company will succeed or stabilize, but whether it will survive. The company carries roughly $24 billion in net debt (versus a market capitalization of just $1.9 billion). Debt investors are pricing in significant risks for the company's unsecured debt, for example the 3.375% convertible bonds maturing in 2026, less than 3 years away, are trading at $44.30, an implied yield of 37% and are rated \"CCC-\" S & P a high-default risk, although the company's secured debt carries a higher B rating and is yielding just under 13%. Some options traders believe that the already hard hit stock could fall further. For example, we saw a traders paying $1 for the June $3.50 puts. The stock would need to fall below $2.50/share for those puts to be profitable. These types of trades are sometimes used to hedge positions in the debt. Lucid spread bets Another company that reported earnings and is facing cash flow concerns is EV maker Lucid Group Inc. (LCID) . EV sales have been under pressure as the auto majors continue to lose money on their electric vehicles, and have been forced to provide incentives and discounts on some models. This pressure has been aggravated by Tesla, which seems to be one of the few automakers that can turn a profit on EVs and has instituted some aggressive price cuts of their own. The auto industry is capital intensive and the $4.4 billion in cash Lucid has on hand amounts to just 5 quarters of runway given the street's current negative cash flow projections. Wednesday's most active contract was the January 2025 $3.00 puts, over 56,000 traded. It appears much of that volume traded on spreads including this large May 2024 $4/Jan 2025 $3 ratio diagonal illustrated below. A diagonal spread is a spread whereby an option trader buys (sell) an option of one strike and expiration and sells (buys) an option of another strike and another expiration. These are called diagonals because they go out in time and up or down in strike. In the case of LCID, someone sold the May $4 puts to buy the Jan 2025 $3 puts (on a ratio). Illustrating spreads with two different expiration dates is a bit challenging of course and in this case the breakevens are as/of May expiration, but a possible explanation is that the trader believes the company could potentially raise more capital from large investors, the most notable of which is the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, which would mitigate cash concerns, but if they fail to do so longer term, the equity could come under further pressure. Datadog's big move Some earnings results have been quite positive though. One of the most active single-stock options so far this week are those of Datadog (DDOG) , which reported earnings on Tuesday. Flow was very heavy on Monday, trading nearly 6 times average daily options volume. The options market was implying an earnings related move of $10 by week's end, and that proved to be conservative as the shares have rallied more than double that amount as usage growth shows sign of improvement and a number of analyst upgrades and price target raises followed. Sometimes options traders make bets that something big will happen, other times they make bets that big moves probably won't happen, and such was the case Wednesday when an option trader sold 3500 December 22nd weekly $85 puts in the name at $1.02. A put seller is willing to get long the underlying stock at the strike price should it fall below that level by expiration. In this case DDOG would need to fall 16% or more for that to happen, and in the meantime if it doesn't the put seller is collecting 1.2% of the strike price in premium on a trade that expires in 6 weeks. This reinforces an important point. Some options sellers try to chase high premiums, premiums which are elevated going into events such as earnings, while others are willing to collect smaller amounts during periods when few catalysts are likely to move the stock sharply. Options premiums in DDOG were high going into earnings, but not high enough as the sharp move higher illustrated. Now that earnings are out, the put seller depicted below is betting a sharp move lower in the next month and half is unlikely.

        "content": "Ad Amazon (AMZN) said on Wednesday that it's offering Prime members a discount on its new health-care service — another perk that should help bring more people into the online retailer's ecosystem. The One Medical service, which typically costs $199 annually, will be available to Prime subscribers for $9 a month or $99 per year. It provides members unlimited 24/7 access to virtual care as well as in-person, and remote primary care services. Prime members can add up to five people from their family to the One Medical plan for an additional $6 a month. Amazon bought One Medical in July 2022. 'Anything that boosts the value of a Prime subscription – which is already one of the great bang for your buck services out there – should be positive Amazon over the long run,' said Jeff Marks, the Club's director of portfolio analysts. 'The One Medical addition won't move the needle today, but Amazon's business model is built on attracting people into its Prime ecosystem and offering quality products and services at competitive prices, making today's announcement incremental,' he explained. To be sure, we are not highly focused on the company's health-care initiatives just yet. Rather, the Club is more concerned with Amazon's cloud revenue growth stabilization and how management is unlocking efficiencies in its retail fulfillment network. It's also still early days for Amazon in health care. Before acquiring One Medical, the e-commerce and cloud giant bought medtech startup Health Navigator in October 2019 and online pharmacy Pillpack in September 2018. This is a 'step in the right direction' for Amazon advancing its efforts in health care, said Tom Forte, analyst at D.A. Davidson. Although Forte mentioned, it might be more difficult to penetrate because the industry is highly regulated. From a company strategy standpoint, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is 'focusing Amazon as a service,' Forte explained, rather than just a first-party retail play, given the higher services margin profile. A growth part of the company's services business, the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud, has slowed recently but 'that's somewhat a reflection of the economy,' the D.A. Davidson said. 'Amazon already has a substantial business in health care today and it also shows its strategic priority for Amazon under Jassy,' Forte said, pointing to Amazon Pharmacy, One Medical, and the cloud computing customers it has in the health care space. 'Health care has the potential to be very meaningful for Amazon given it's a large total addressable market.' In a D.A. Davidson August 2023 white paper, analysts said there's 'a greater than 10% chance Amazon can generate an incremental 100 basis points of revenue growth in 2026 by exploiting health care' through Amazon Pharmacy and AWS sales it generates from health care companies. Amazon offering a discounted subscription to One Medical's services is part of the company's efforts to expand the broader Prime flywheel by leveraging its 167 million Prime members. The goal of the Amazon Prime membership is to provide people with 'one simple membership, something that provides shopping, savings, streaming and now positive health outcomes, said Jamil Ghani, SVP of Amazon Prime in a CNBC interview Wednesday.

        "content": "What a distinction per week makes. Following final week's stumbles, the Dow Jones Industrial Common , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all monitoring to go wire-to-wire this week, with five-straight days of beneficial properties. Dovish rhetoric from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a Goldilocks (not too scorching, not too chilly) jobs report from the U.S. Labor Division on Friday pulled bond yields decrease, which supported shares. On Monday and Tuesday, the market had a hangover from final week and was nonetheless oversold, in accordance with the S & P 500 Quick Vary Oscillator . However we may see the tide was turning. After seven straight periods in oversold territory, the Oscillator flipped to impartial after the shut Wednesday and remained there heading into Friday's session. Our trades and selections on inventory rankings have been pushed extra by earnings, company-specific developments and portfolio administration moderately than any broad commentary in the marketplace. Tuesday We downgraded Ford Motor (F) to a 2 score as a result of the post-earnings decline within the inventory was not a selloff that we have been taken with shopping for . Final week, Ford delivered an earnings miss resulting from decrease volumes and a $1.2 billion enhance in guarantee bills. Additionally troubling: Ford's bumpy transition to electrical autos and impending larger labor prices that the United Auto Employees union extracted throughout its six-week strike. Wednesday We purchased 75 extra shares of GE HealthCare Applied sciences (GEHC), the day after the medical gear maker reported robust third-quarter outcomes , together with strong margin growth. The inventory soared greater than 5% on the information, including to these beneficial properties all through the remainder of the week. Nonetheless, GEHC shares are nonetheless down considerably from April's year-to-date excessive and down huge even from mini-rallies in June and July. We purchased 50 extra shares of Oracle (ORCL) as a result of latest cloud-industry commentary bodes properly for the corporate. Oracle reviews earnings subsequent week. This was the second week by which we added to our Oracle place, shopping for up shares on Oct. 23 after an unwarranted selloff following administration's remarks on the firm's AI Government Discussion board occasion. We additionally downgraded Estee Lauder (EL) to a 4 score and eliminated our value goal on the inventory after an incredibly unhealthy quarter. We knew issues weren't going to be good. Nonetheless, the posh magnificence firm's warning on ahead steerage known as into query administration's credibility. Estee Lauder's new 'Revenue Restoration Plan' offered little consolation as a result of it is not anticipated to kick in till the corporate's fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Thursday We exited our smallest place, Veralto (VLTO) — promoting all of the shares we acquired when the water high quality was spun off final month from Membership title Danaher (DHR). Veralto is presently experiencing headwinds, together with weak point in China. Furthermore, Membership title DuPont de Nemours (DD) has an identical water enterprise. So, we intend to consolidate the water-quality danger and purchase extra DuPont when our buying and selling restrictions enable. However water is just not why we personal DuPont, whose electronics and industrial enterprise is on the cusp of a restoration. The specialty chemical substances big makes supplies and coatings for the {industry}. Friday We bought 250 shares of Foot Locker (FL), taking a troublesome loss to keep away from giving again a virtually 40% restoration within the inventory over the previous two months. You may't solely promote winners for a revenue. Typically you must chunk the bullet and promote losers to mitigate danger. That is precisely what we did with Foot Locker, which has been a horrible inventory. We'll look to reallocate this money into different positions that we predict have stronger basic setups within the quarters forward.

        "description": "This holiday shopping season is a market share story — a zero-sum game.",
        "content": "The bad news: Consumers aren't expected to spend more this holiday season. The good news: Our retail stocks should do well anyway. A new Morgan Stanley survey of 2,000 consumers found 37% plan to spend the same on shopping this year-end as they did in 2023, while 27% say they will spend less and 10% are not planning to shop at all. Just 25% of consumers plan to spend more over the next couple months. Shoppers also remain budget conscious, with 69% saying they will wait to see discounts before spending. On average, shoppers are looking for a sale of at least 30%. Some parts of the retail will be harder hit, Morgan Stanley said. The analysts are cautious on hardline goods like electronics, furniture and appliances, as well as broadline retailers that sell a wide range of goods like Target and Walmart. The outlook is better for so-called softline retailers (apparel) and brands because they have decreased inventory to protect profit margins. With spending in line with last year, this holiday shopping season becomes a market share story — a zero-sum game. Growth by one retailer will likely come at the expense of another. That makes it a stock pickers market. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) of retail stocks is likely to be stuffed with as many losers as winners. Given these data points, we feel pretty good about our exposure. We have owned discount retailer TJX all year on the view that inflation and belt-tightening could result in a trade down from full-priced retailers to discounters offering brand names at lower prices. TJX report earnings on Nov. 15 and we hope the strength we heard about at the start of the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter. We'll update members on our position after the management's call with investors. We maintain our 2 ratings on shares and would consider buying more on a pullback. Club name Costco (COST) is all about providing good value on the discretionary front. But the retailer also generates a large portion of sales from consumer staples, so we don't see it coming under any undue pressure and would expect the company to benefit from holiday food shopping. Like TJX, Costco is currently trading near all-time highs, so we maintain a 2 rating and would look for a dip before adding to the position. Foot Locker (FL) has issues outside of the holiday season such as an inventory glut, an overreliance on Nike (NKE) and the need to shut down unprofitable stores. But the expected consumer focus on softlines within the goods category could provide something of a tailwind as Foot Locker flushes out some excess inventory. Same goes for embattled Estee Lauder (EL) which has been dogged by weak Asian travel retail. It's a wait-and-see on both of these names. We are keeping our exposure small and even recently trimmed our stake in Foot Locker. We see no reason to change our 4 rating on both stocks ahead of the holiday season. Then there is Amazon (AMZN). The analysts did note that e-commerce has decelerated since the summer, setting up for a slower holiday, but we believe Amazon still have room to run. We maintain a 1 rating. a One rating, has more room to run. A couple of findings from the report bolster our position. First, the data points to higher-income shoppers planning to do more buying online, and Amazon is better-positioned than its peers. Second, Amazon has been making great progress on its fulfillment optimization plans so any pressure we do see on the timeline should be at least partially offset by margin improvement further down the P & L statement. Bottom line We are in a good position to benefit from how discretionary dollars will be spent this holiday season. Amazon stands to benefit from cost optimization and a rebound in its cloud service (AWS). TJX Companies offers the best value in retail along with an unmatched treasure-hunting experience that is sure to draw in shoppers. Costco, with its club membership model, benefits from offering a strong value on both discretionary goods and consumer staples by selling in bulk, along with the food everyone wants needs for holiday gatherings. Estee Lauder and Foot Locker are problematic and we're keeping them both small into the season. Of the two, FL could break out if consumers spend more on footwear and apparel.

        "description": "What a difference a week makes. Following last week's stumbles, the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all",
        "content": "What a difference a week makes. Following last week's stumbles, the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all tracking to go wire-to-wire this week, with five-straight days of gains. Dovish rhetoric from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a Goldilocks (not too hot, not too cold) jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department on Friday pulled bond yields lower, which supported stocks. On Monday and Tuesday, the market had a hangover from last week and was still oversold, according to the S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator . But we could see the tide was turning. After seven straight sessions in oversold territory, the Oscillator flipped to neutral after the close Wednesday and remained there heading into Friday's session. Our trades and decisions on stock ratings were driven more by earnings, company-specific developments and portfolio management rather than any broad commentary on the market. Tuesday We downgraded Ford Motor (F) to a 2 rating because the post-earnings decline in the stock was not a selloff that we were interested in buying . Last week, Ford delivered an earnings miss due to lower volumes and a $1.2 billion increase in warranty expenses. Also troubling: Ford's bumpy transition to electric vehicles and impending higher labor costs that the United Auto Workers union extracted during its six-week strike. Wednesday We bought 75 more shares of GE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC), the day after the medical equipment maker reported strong third-quarter results , including solid margin expansion. The stock soared more than 5% on the news, adding to those gains throughout the rest of the week. However, GEHC shares are still down significantly from April's year-to-date high and down big even from mini-rallies in June and July. We bought 50 more shares of Oracle (ORCL) because recent cloud-industry commentary bodes well for the company. Oracle reports earnings next week. This was the second week in which we added to our Oracle position, buying up shares on Oct. 23 after an unwarranted selloff following management's remarks at the company's AI Executive Forum event. We also downgraded Estee Lauder (EL) to a 4 rating and removed our price target on the stock after a shockingly bad quarter. We knew things were not going to be good. However, the luxury beauty company's warning on forward guidance called into question management's credibility. Estee Lauder's new 'Profit Recovery Plan' provided little comfort because it's not expected to kick in until the company's fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Thursday We exited our smallest position, Veralto (VLTO) — selling all the shares we received when the water quality was spun off last month from Club name Danaher (DHR). Veralto is currently experiencing headwinds, including weakness in China. Moreover, Club name DuPont de Nemours (DD) has a similar water business. So, we intend to consolidate the water-quality risk and buy more DuPont when our trading restrictions allow. But water is not why we own DuPont, whose electronics and industrial business is on the cusp of a recovery. The specialty chemicals giant makes materials and coatings for the industry. Friday We sold 250 shares of Foot Locker (FL), taking a tough loss to avoid giving back a nearly 40% recovery in the stock over the past two months. You can't only sell winners for a profit. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet and sell losers to mitigate risk. That's exactly what we did with Foot Locker, which has been a terrible stock. We'll look to reallocate this cash into other positions that we think have stronger fundamental setups in the quarters ahead. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long F, GEHC, ORCL, EL, DHR, DD, FL.

        "description": "Events this week from Constellation Brands (STZ) and Starbucks (SBUX) left shareholders like us bullish on the path forward for both beverage makers.",
        "content": "Investor events this week from Club holdings Constellation Brands (STZ) and Starbucks (SBUX) left shareholders like us bullish on the path forward for both beverage makers. Beer producer Constellation Brands provided a business update on Thursday during an event for investors at which management outlined its strategic priorities to foster ongoing growth. On the same day, coffee giant Starbucks held an investor event after reporting strong quarterly results before the opening bell report — an earnings report that restored investor confidence and demonstrated Starbucks' commitment to transforming its business in the U.S. and across the globe. Constellation Brands STZ YTD mountain STZ performance year-to-date. The company called its beer business, which includes bestselling brands like Modelo Especial, Corona and Pacifico, \"the main driver of our strong growth.\" Management reiterated its 7% to 9% net annual sales-growth forecast for its beer business over the medium term. Constellation also sees sequential improvement in revenue growth for its historically underperforming wine-and-spirits business, which includes brand names like Woodbridge, Kim Crawford and SVEDKA. In fiscal year 2025, the company believes it can reach 1% to 3% net sales growth for the division, below a prior range of 2% to 4% growth. The company expects organic sales at the wine-and-spirits unit to decline 1% to 2% in fiscal year 2024. Constellation said Thursday that it expects to deliver double-digit diluted earnings-per-share (EPS) growth in the medium term, while also growing its operating cash flow. And management also announced a $2 billion share-repurchase authorization. The Club's take: We were hoping to see Constellation separate its wine-and-spirits business, but we can also make the case that its better to wait and not sell while the business is down. If management delivers on its goal of sequential improvement to both the top line and profitability while hitting its targets, the wine-and-spirits unit could attract a more willing buyer. We were pleased to see the company reiterate its medium-term growth expectation for its beer business, while targeting low double-digit EPS growth excluding losses from its cannabis business, Canopy Growth. Constellation's $2 billion share repurchase shows its disciplined approach to capital allocation, and we expect to see more consistent capital returns in the future. Indeed, activist investor Elliot Management, which entered into a cooperation agreement with Constellation earlier this year , said it is working with management to create long-term shareholder value. We added to our position in Constellation last week. Starbucks SBUX YTD mountain SBUX year-to-date performance Starbucks Thursday delivered a much better-than-expected fiscal fourth quarter , in addition to an encouraging update on its business during its investor day. A standout for the coffee giant was its stellar performance in China, the growth segment of its international business. Same-store sales in China for the quarter were up 5% year-over-year, beating analysts' forecasts of 4.7%. Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan on Thursday told Jim Cramer about the coffee giant's plans to \"continue to grow\" in the world's second largest economy. Despite the slow post-pandemic recovery, Starbucks continues to attract customers in China as a result of its high-end brand appeal. \"The momentum against the backdrop of headwinds in China this past year give us optimism in our position and affirms our distinctive competitive advantages for our business,\" Narasimhan said Thursday on the company's post-earnings conference call. The company added 326 stores in China last quarter, bringing its total count to 6,806. Starbucks' goal is to reach 9,000 stores in the country by 2025. Starbucks said it plans to improve customer convenience through increased mobile orders and drive-thru options at stores, while also investing in new equipment. And the company said it's expanding its reward-membership program globally, putting it on track to double its membership to 75 million customers within the next five years. Lastly, Starbucks detailed strong demand in North America, where average weekly sales outpaced pre-pandemic levels by double digits last quarter. To address this unrelenting demand, Starbucks plans on building new stores with updated layouts, while \"unlocking capacity\" at existing stores. The company currently operates 17,800 stores in the U.S. and Canada. The Club's take: This is a different Starbucks that is focused on increasing efficiencies. The company is run by a consumer expert in CEO Narasimhan, who we believe will lead the company to successfully execute on its targets. In addition to investing in its stores, Starbucks is also taking steps to improve the overall experience for its employees. It is a much better-run company than in the past. While there are still ongoing macroeconomic challenges in China, management is taking a long-term perspective as it continues to eye a huge growth opportunity in the country. We last added to our position in Starbucks at the start of October. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long STZ, SBUX. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

        "description": "Small-cap U.S. stocks, which have been lagging their large-cap peers all year, surged more than 5% Tuesday.",
        "content": "Small-cap U.S. stocks, which have been lagging their large-cap peers all year, surged more than 5% Tuesday, after October's CPI data showed inflation cooling at a faster pace than expected. I like to utilize the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) which seeks to track the investment results of the Russell 2000 index, measuring the performance of the small-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market. The lagging index chalked up its best day since November 2022, when it rose over 6%. I believe that this is just the beginning for small caps recovering. Small caps have been struggling versus their peers as a rising interest rate environment has absolutely punished these growth companies. The Russell 2000 ETF is finally positive in 2023 and now up just over 3% year-to-date, versus a 17% pop for the large-cap S & P 500 ETF (SPY) and a sensational 45% surge for the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) . My thesis of small caps finally getting up off the mat is based upon my recent and lonely call of U.S. Treasury yields relenting. The 60-basis point drop in the 10-year yield (5.02% down to 4.42%) has unilaterally brought down borrowing costs for consumers as well as small market capitalized constituents of the Russell 2000. (1 basis point equals 0.01%.) These lower rates are like rocket fuel for these oversold and unloved companies. So, will small caps recover or was this a one-day pop you ask? As long as U.S. Treasury yields remain off their highs and expectations are for the Fed to be on pause for the foreseeable future, the answer is yes. In addition, I have repositioned my model portfolios' exposure to include small caps for the remaining six trading weeks of 2023. A risk reversal The option strategy that I want to utilize to potentially gain exposure to small caps is via a zero-cost spread. Better known as a risk reversal, but instead of usually putting this spread on for a credit, I am putting this on at no-cost as the upside call is more expensive than usual, aka the call is \"bid\". \"Bid\" meaning that I am not alone in this idea of small caps finding some legs between now and the end of the year. This approach has risk in owning the underlying by possibly being assigned to the put being sold. However, I am willing and comfortable owning small caps at this level since there is a nearly 20% difference in IWM and SPY from the market low back in October of 2022. This zero-cost spread can be established by selling an out-of-the money put and using the premium collected in writing that put option to buy an upside OTM call for the same price. The same expiration will be used for both the put and the call options. Looking at a chart for 2023, I believe that the January and July highs of $198 could be revisited if IWM can close above its 200-day moving average at $181.23. Risk Reversal specific to the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM): Sold the regular expiration December $175 put for $2.20 (which is a little more than 2% lower from Nov. 14 close) Bought the regular expiration December $185 call for $2.20 The result in the sale of the put and the purchase of the call results in zero cost for this bullish spread A risk reversal strategy involves buying an out-of-the-money call and selling an out-of-the-money put. You want IWM to go above your long call strike as much as possible. You have unlimited profit potential to the upside, but you also have unlimited downside risk too. Generally, the advantage of a risk reversal is putting on a bullish position with a long call, but by spending very limited cash upfront (in this case, zero cash upfront) because you are financing the purchase with the sale of a downside put. Aggressive bull trade Typically, a risk reversal is a hedging strategy that protects a long or short position by using put and call options simultaneously. This strategy can protect against unfavorable price movements in the underlying position but also limits the profits that can be made on that position. If an investor is long a stock or ETF, they could create a short risk reversal to hedge their position by buying a put option and selling a call option. This risk reversal is being used as an aggressive bull trade. Since I am buying a higher strike price call option and financing the premium paid by selling an out-of-the-money put option, I am essentially putting on a bull trade for no cost. If I am correct, and IWM continues to recover higher, the short put will become worthless, and the long call will increase in value — generating a considerable profit. However, if I am incorrect about small caps recovering, I will be forced to buy IWM at the short put strike price minus the premium collected. In this case, I would own IWM at $175 as I collected $0.00 on the spread/risk reversal. This strategy is considered risky and can generate significant losses, all short puts should be cash covered. Being forced to buy IWM lower is still a better outcome than if I would have simply purchased the ETF outright at $179. DISCLOSURES: (Long IWM and the options spread.)

        "description": "Investors are getting an opportunity to add to their positions in the Medicare Advantage-focused health insurer.",
        "content": "The post-earnings decline in Humana (HUM) shares Wednesday was overdone, providing investors an opportunity to add to their positions in the Medicare Advantage-focused health insurer. The Club holding remains on solid ground after delivering a top- and bottom-line beat in the third quarter. Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 15.9% to $26.42 billion, topping analyst estimates of $25.55 billion, according to data provider LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $7.78 exceeded the consensus estimate of $7.16. Humana's companywide benefits expense ratio — also known as the medical loss ratio or MLR — came in at 86.4% in the quarter, below the 86.7% projected by analysts, according to FactSet. On this metric, lower is better. However, Humana's insurance segment MLR came in higher than expected, which was part of the reason for the stock decline. HUM YTD mountain Humana YTD Humana's quarter has some blemishes, but we see no reason to join the parade of sellers who are pushing the stock down more than 5% to under $500 per share. \"The story is on track, and I think you buy the stock,\" Jim Cramer said during Wednesday's Morning Meeting . \"But you have to understand and respect sellers who are all trying to get out at once and don't even realize they've created an opportunity. It should no longer be sold down here. I would be a buyer of Humana at the end of the day.\" Bottom line Ultimately, Humana's recent outperformance made the stock vulnerable to pullback on an imperfect report. Since its 2023 lows on July 13, Humana stock rallied more than 23% compared with a roughly 7% slide in the S & P 500 over the same stretch. More recently, Humana shares are up nearly 5% since Oct. 12 — the day before rival UnitedHealth Group 's (UNH) strong quarterly results — while the S & P 500 dropped 3.6%. We booked profits on our Humana position on Oct. 6, making good on our pledge to trim once the stock recovered to the $500-per-share level. One of the third-quarter blemishes: Humana experienced higher-than-anticipated medical costs in the period due to an increase in Covid-related hospital admissions, leading its medical loss ratio, or MLR, in that segment to come in above expectations. Given these recent trends, the company had to increase its full-year insurance MLR guidance to 87.5%, up from its prior target range of 86.3% to 87.3%. Quarterly commentary Investors have been concerned about medical costs for Humana and its insurance peers since June, when UnitedHealth first warned about a rise in elective procedures — and soon after, Humana said it was seeing similar trends. While second-quarter earnings assuaged the worst of Wall Street's fears , Humana's Q3 report Wednesday appears to have created some fresh jitters around medical costs, or utilization. The companywide benefits expense ratio of 86.4% can be seen on the quarterly earnings table. At the same time, CFO Susan Diamond offered helpful context around what changed in the third quarter, explaining that the company did not expect to see an uptick in Covid admissions until the final three months of the year. The company decided to be \"somewhat conservative\" and leave its fourth-quarter Covid assumptions unchanged, Diamond said, despite the possibility that some of those costs were pulled forward into the third quarter. Humana has started to see Covid-related costs decline, Diamond said. Management's initial commentary on 2024 earnings and Medicare Advantage membership growth — discussed in more detail below — may also have left investors wanting. While these developments are not ideal, we think Humana also may be offering a conservative view on 2024. That is an understandable approach to take given it's still early in the enrollment cycle, and next year will be one of transition for the company. CEO Bruce Broussard, who has led the insurer for a decade, is set to retire in late 2024, the company announced in October. His replacement, health-care veteran Jim Rechtin, is slated to join Humana in January and work closely with Broussard on the leadership hand-off. Outlook Once again, Humana boosted its projections for 2023 individual Medicare Advantage membership growth — this time by 35,000 to approximately 860,000 members. That would mark a 19% increase compared with year-end enrollment levels in 2022. Humana's initial 2023 guidance — put forth a year ago — forecasted growth between 7.1% and 8.7%. Humana raised its full-year insurance segment MLR guidance to 87.5%, up from its prior target between 86.3% to 87.3%. For months, the company had said it expected to come in near the top of the old range, but the third-quarter medical cost trends prompted Wednesday's upward revision. Remember, on this metric, lower is better. Humana maintained its full-year adjusted EPS projection of at least $28.25 while lowering its EPS outlook on a generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP) basis. The company now expects GAAP EPS of at least $26.31, down from at least $26.91. Looking ahead to 2024, Humana expects its Medicare Advantage membership growth to be \"at or above industry growth level,\" after significantly outperforming the industry in 2023. On the call, outgoing CEO Broussard said industry growth estimates vary for 2024, but offered a range between 6% to 8%. Humana also expects EPS growth in 2024 to fall on the lower end of its historical long-range 11%-to-15% target. Wall Street had been projecting around 13% EPS growth in 2024, according to FactSet. Capital allocation Humana still expects to buy back about $1.5 billion worth of stock in 2023, finance chief Diamond said on the earnings call. So far, repurchases have totaled roughly $1 billion, implying about $200 million worth of buybacks between August's earnings call and Wednesday's call. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long HUM.

        "content": "Investors should not jump to offload Apple (AAPL) shares because of a handful of cautious reports ahead of this week's quarterly results. The narrative shaped by the financial media and Wall Street analysts in recent days questioned Apple's relationship with Alphabet (GOOGL) on Google search, the initial sales of the iPhone 15 in China, and why the tech giant released new Mac computers and personal computer chips so close to earnings. As the most world's valuable company, Apple has always had a target on its back, with people speculating if this quarter is the beginning of the end. Jim Cramer points out that this has been happening since the first iPhone was released in 2007 and even before that. But Apple has been crushing naysayers all the way to a $2.66 trillion market cap. That's why we recommend before taking any action on Apple shares — selling or buying — to wait to hear directly from management when the company issues numbers for its final quarter of fiscal 2023 after the closing bell Thursday. We stand by Jim's \"own it, don't trade it\" mantra on Apple. However, that doesn't mean we stick our heads in the sand. Jim's buy-and-homework mantra means we don't just buy and hold. Even in high-conviction stocks like Apple, we do the homework to constantly test our investment thesis against new developments. So, here's a summary of the news items mentioned above and our Club take on each. The news: On Tuesday, a Wall Street Journal analysis speculated that Apple's lucrative relationship with Alphabet may be on the rocks. The report also detailed headwinds coming from its business in China. \"It's a classic negative piece on the company that crystalizes the 'hate Apple trade' that's been going on,\" Cramer wrote in his Top 10 Things to Watch Tuesday. To be sure, the ongoing Google antitrust trial has scrutinized the billions of dollars paid to Apple and other companies by Alphabet to ensure that Google's search engine and browser are the defaults on devices. The proceedings stem from a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Alphabet three years ago this month, alleging these exclusive deals hurt competition. Last week during the trial, testimony showed that Google paid $26.3 billion to be the default search engine on mobile phones and web browsers in 2021. A recent Berstein research note estimated that up to $20 billion of that total went to Apple. Google has denied the DOJ's claims, arguing its products are just better and more in demand, and it should not be punished for that. The Club's take: We agree as shareholders of both Alphabet and Apple. We don't think Google Search became a market leader just because of its tie-in to Apple but by being the superior service. Headwinds from the DOJ's case to Apple shares are not likely to materialize anytime soon as any verdict no matter what it is would most certainly be appealed. It could take years before there's a final ruling. The news: It looks like the iPhone 15 got off to a slow start in China. According to a recent IDC research report, Apple shipments to China in the third quarter dropped 4%, and its market share there was basically flat from the year-ago period at 16%. Apple moved up a spot to the No. 3 smartphone maker in China behind two local brands, Honor and Oppo. But that was more of a function of a third Chinese maker, vivo, going from No. 1 to No. 4 in smartphones. According to IDC, there was a lot of excitement about China-based Huawei's high-end smartphone to compete with Apple but sees any Huawei impact as more of a Q4 thing. The shifts for Apple in China came after a Sept 6. report in The Wall Street Journal that the Chinese government banned its staffers from using iPhones and other foreign-branded devices at work. A week later, China denied the report but not before Apple suffered a two-session decline of 6% — a loss at the time of $200 billion in market cap. The stock has only dropped more than 4% since then. The Club's take: We doubted the Journal report from the outset and always argued that Apple's position as a premium brand in China hasn't changed despite growing competition for mobile phones. Instead, we think the iPhone remains a formidable player in the Chinese market because of product quality, along with its closed ecosystem and prices. Apple has also been expanding into emerging economies in an effort to diversify its supply chain and curb the risk from tense relations between the U.S. and China. This gives Apple the chance to grab market share in the world's most populous country, India, along with providing downside protection in China, which accounts for roughly 19% of Apple's sales. The news: Apple revealed new product offerings , including MacBook Pro laptops and new PC chips, at its \"Scary Fast\" event Monday evening. The event came days prior to its earnings release, raising suspicions on Wall Street about the timing. \"[This] causes us to worry that laptop and iMac sales were weak in the Sept [quarter],\" Needham analysts wrote in a Tuesday research note. \"That would suggest that last night's launch was a way to mitigate any negative share price reaction, because AAPL can focus on the future and reiterate how optimistic it is about unit sales of its new laptops and iMac products.\" The Club's take: We view this is largely speculative — and, instead, prefer to see Apple quarterly results and hear from management Thursday evening before rendering any judgment.

        "description": "Airlines rely on data throughout the organization, but challenges around technical silos and legacy systems persist and carriers are cautious of not letting AI hype run away with them.",
        "content": "The old adage of garbage in, garbage out has perhaps never been truer for airlines as past challenges of accessing and making use of data are somewhat compounded by a fresh data hurdle - generative artificial intelligence.\nWhen you think about it, most of an airline's operations — from maintenance to crew management, booking to check-in, boarding and so much more — rely on data.\nLike other segments within the travel industry grappling with generative AI hype, airlines and airports are working to uncover the uses cases that will drive operational efficiency and/or improve the customer experience.\nSo what are the concerns? What are the barriers to progress when it comes to data usage and generative AI developments?\nHype around generative AI is a big consideration according to airline, airport and travel technology executives, and there is a real sense of the importance of getting the basics right first.\nAt the recent World Aviation Festival in Lisbon, Xavier Lagardere, chief data officer of Lufthansa Group, stressed the need for good data.\n'We're in the hype of generative AI and one thing not to forget is that good AI comes with good data,\" he said during a session on using data. \"In the current advances of bringing generative AI, generating efficiencies, driving personalized conversations with customers, we need to start with driving good data.'\nTristan Thomas, director of digital technology and innovation at Etihad, agreed and said generative AI had become an 'everyday tool.'\n'It's an unusual position for a technology professional because you then have to work out how it is going to impact your world. It's reaching an incredible hype moment, and as with all hyped technologies you need to go back to the point of what problems are we solving, that has to be the core of this,\" Thomas said. \"We can remember being on this stage five years ago and talking about blockchain, and the dangers are there again where you start hunting down uses for a technology as opposed to what do I want to solve with this technology. I think it is life changing. We just need to work out how we use it.'\nLagardere added that one difference with generative AI versus blockchain is that 'it's in the hands of everybody at our companies.'\n'So the wave that's coming at us is not even top-down mandated or coming out of some fancy innovation department,\" he said. \"It's a wave that is coming from the users themselves, so in a way it's not only different from an adoption curve standpoint, but it mandates us as corporations to bring a response and make use of it.'\nGet a dose of digital travel in your inbox each day Subscribe to our newsletter below Submit I accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy\nAlongside the hype is also excitement about the possibilities, said Tara Mulrooney, chief technology officer and vice president of innovation at Edmonton International Airport.\n'I'm really excited about generative AI, not just because of the tool, but it's helping us learn how to be data citizens,\" Mulrooney said. \"It's pervasive, so if we can get everyone to learn those skills, especially our children and others, it's what they're going to be able to do with that capability and not have the struggles of collecting the data and managing the data.'\nThough the relevance of historical data around consumer behavior was questioned as the pandemic subsided, airlines say it's not that the data is obsolete, but rather how and when they need it that has changed.\n'It has become more necessary,\" Lagardere said. \"What we've lost with the pandemic is the certainties we had. Last year there was a fantastic post-summer boom and everyone would say it's pent-up demand. This year again, so maybe it's the new normal, who knows? So we've lost this predictability, which means we need to be more synchronous with the signals that are coming live through the system, so it actually makes the data more relevant.'\nInfluencing outcomes\nThe good news is that airline teams now seem to be better at working together, with operations having greater influence where they might have had to cede to commercial teams in the past.\nMitrankur Majumdar, senior vice president and global head of services at Infosys, acknowledged the change.\n'As new pressures start building up — whether cost related, sustainability or broader supply chain concerns, all of those have put pressure on the routing and scheduling abilities, and aircraft availability has also become a challenge. Put together, this has put huge pressure on the network optimization part,\" Majumdar said. \"What this does is bring operations to have a higher influence in some shape, so a shift has happened. Earlier there was a lot of opaqueness in terms of the data sharing, but this whole realization has come in that for operational excellence and enhanced customer experience they have to transcend the silos.'\nThis doesn't mean all the problems have disappeared with technical silos still hampering progress. Mulrooney blamed the products put forth by vending partners. \"We are held hostage by proprietary closed architectures, so my plea to all of you is adopt open architectures and open standards, or we will look elsewhere for our software and solutions.'\nA further cautionary note was sounded by Andrew Eliseev, global head of consumer and retail at Luxoft, who urged carriers to address their technical debt.\n'The future of airlines is not just about all these AI use cases and fancy innovations in the customer experience,\" Eliseev said. \"It's also about the invisible but very crucial aspect of technical debt. It's not just an IT problem, it's an organizational challenge that has to be addressed.'\nA recent Luxoft study found that 46% of executives believe technical debt 'dramatically prevents them from innovating,' he said.\n'Almost half are held back by outdated systems and technologies,\" Eliseev said. \"I believe that is the main problem, and until we resolve this issue with legacy systems, you can't build on top of all of these new technologies like AI and digital twins. So we'll always be linked back to the lowest, weakest part of the chain.'\nOne way of getting round this is to have 'kind of a two-speed IT,' according to Majumdar.\n'The foundation has to be changed if you really want to capitalize on this kind of technology, but at the same time you cannot spend all your time on building foundations when the world has already moved on,\" Majumdar said. \"So you have to have some kind of a balance. There are certain areas you can make some sort of progress because the world has already made some progress, you don't want to miss the bus, but I agree the foundation has to be changed to maximize these things.'",

        "description": "\"The incumbent almost always wins,\" Jim Cramer said this week.",
        "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) remains our favorite way to play the weight-loss drug market, despite a new entry this week from AstraZeneca (AZN). On Thursday, AstraZeneca said it paid $185 million upfront to acquire the rights to an experimental weight-loss pill from Eccogene, a Chinese biotech startup. AstraZeneca hopes to begin two mid-stage trials for the drug, known as ECC5004, by the end of 2024, investigating its efficacy in treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes, respectively. Additional competition for Eli Lilly is to be expected, considering how lucrative the market expected to be. Sales forecasts on Wall Street vary, but multiple analysts now project obesity drugs to generate at least $100 billion in annual revenue down the road. However, Eli Lilly may have a first-mover advantage. Its obesity pill is much further along in development than ECC5004, though both figure to be years away from actually hitting the market. \"The company that already has something approved is far more likely to get a pill formulation approved than one that doesn't,\" Jim Cramer said Friday. \"The incumbent almost always wins.\" Eli Lilly shares had their worst day of the year Thursday, falling 4.5% in the session to close at $591.32. AstraZeneca's encroachment on turf currently dominated by Eli Lilly and Danish rival Novo Nordisk (NVO) may have contributed to Thursday's declines. But a bigger driver may have simply been profit-taking after U.S. regulators on Wednesday officially green-lit the Club holding's entrance into the obesity market. That approval, despite being widely expected, pushed Eli Lilly to an all-time closing high Wednesday, at $619.13 per share. Shares of Eli Lilly were up roughly 0.5% Friday, shaking off early morning declines. Friday's action comes ahead of a commercially significant data presentation this weekend from Novo Nordisk, which has the potential to lift its stock and shares of Eli Lilly . Jim said Friday investors should consider buying Eli Lilly ahead of that presentation at the American Heart Association conference. LLY 1Y mountain Eli Lilly's stock performance over the past 12 months. U.K.-based AstraZeneca's ECC5004 belongs to the same category as Eli Lilly's tirzepatide and Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, known as GLP-1s. Those are the active ingredients in Eli Lilly's diabetes treatment Mounjaro and recently approved weight-loss drug Zepbound, and Novo's Ozempic for diabetes and Wegoy for obesity. All four are injectable drugs. Interest in GLP-1 drugs has soared over the past year, creating supply shortages that both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are scrambling to alleviate with investments in additional manufacturing capacity. GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone in the gut — glucagon-like peptide 1 — to help control blood sugar and effectively suppresses appetite, which can lead to weight loss. Unlike Ozempic and Wegovy, Eli Lilly's tirzepatide targets a second gut hormone, abbreviated as GIP, which the company believes adds to the drug's effectiveness in weight loss. Eli Lilly's GLP-1 efforts are core to our investment thesis in the company, as their promise to treat obesity and deliver other health benefits, such as lower the risk of serious heart problems, should help fuel robust growth in the years ahead. Jim has repeatedly said Eli Lilly's tirzepatide — under the Mounjaro and Zepbound brands — will become the best-selling drug of all time. When asked about AstraZeneca's latest move on CNBC Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said: \"On the one hand, if you're running a major pharmaceutical company, you have to pay attention to this category. It's probably malpractice not to consider investing in obesity given the opportunity ahead.\" \"On the other hand, I think Lilly is a leader here, and we plan to make it hard to be caught,\" Ricks said. Eli Lilly is well-equipped to handle new competition for a few reasons, including its significant investments in manufacturing capacity to help meet fervent demand; a key production site in North Carolina is online, with another one in the state scheduled to be finished next year. For its part, Novo Nordisk is working to boost Ozempic and Wegovy supply, with its CEO telling Reuters on Friday that it's upping investments in Denmark. Eli Lilly's GLP-1 pipeline also looks formidable, setting it up for commercial success beyond just Mounjaro and Zepbound. Mid-stage study results released in June showed that Eli Lilly's own weight-loss pill, orforglipron, was highly effective, and the company has initiated late-stage trials with it for obesity and Type 2 diabetes . Both studies are estimated to be complete in 2025, according to U.S. government website that tracks trials. In Thursday's CNBC interview, Ricks alluded to the fact orforglipron is further along in development than some other oral GP1-s, including AstraZeneca's ECC5004. However, an AstraZeneca executive on Thursday touted ECC5004 as having fewer side effects than other oral GLP-1s with \"efficacy on par with competitors in this class.\" Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk has said it plans to submit its obesity pill to U.S. regulators by year-end. In general, pharmaceutical companies see oral GLP-1 drugs as a way to expand the obesity market , even if they don't generate as much weight loss as injectable versions like Wegovy and Zepbound. Eli Lilly has another experimental weight-loss drug called retatrutide that stands out for targeting a third hormone beyond just GLP-1 and GIP. A late-stage study for retatrutide began this year and is estimated to be completed in 2026 . Against this backdrop, we see Eli Lilly on solid footing as other pharmaceutical companies, like AstraZeneca, that are understandably making moves to compete in the GLP-1 market. And in its battle with Novo Nordisk, more specifically, there is ample room for both companies right now because obesity is such a nascent opportunity. Indeed, Citigroup analysts frame the Lilly-Novo debate as one of \"market-creation,\" rather than \"market-share.\" They reiterated that longstanding view in a note to clients Friday, arguing Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk should enjoy a \"structural duopoly well into the next decade.\" Our desire to own Eli Lilly over Novo Nordisk hinges, in part, on our confidence in Eli Lilly's other treatment opportunities, such as in Alzheimer's. Eli Lilly's leading drug candidate, donanemab, is awaiting U.S. regulatory approval in early 2024. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long LLY. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

        "description": "Let's review how options traders are positioned ahead of the key results due this week.",
        "content": "Nearly 90% of the Russell 1000 index have reported earnings this seen so we'll start focusing on some other catalysts soon, but a few big reports remain. Let's review how options traders are positioned ahead of the key results due this week. As always lines, highlighted in green below are names we hold (long), and to ensure they catch the eye, those earnings related moves that are greater than 5% as implied by current options prices are highlighted in yellow. Down nearly 25% year-to-date, Tyson Foods (TSN) , traded well above average options flow on Friday. The November $40 puts were most active. Street analysts tend to skew optimistic, most stocks have far more \"buy\" recommendations than \"holds\" or \"sells\". Such is not the case for TSN because the company has been facing several pressures concurrently. Stagnant topline and declining margins mean that the trailing multiple is actually higher despite the sharp price declines. As a potential counterpoint, I would offer that cost-saving efforts such as plant closings and increased automation take time to implement. As a food company, TSN isn't a cyclical per se, but a truism of cyclical businesses is that they trade at the cheapest multiple at market peaks and the richest multiple at troughs as the market will bake-in some earnings mean reversion. Full year EPS of $1.19 a share represents a decade low, and if it can claw back to the $2.84 a share consensus for FY2024 that would represent 16.5 times multiple. We don't own it, but I would not press shorts in the name and we're getting to a point where I might be inclined to buck the market's bearish posture. Keep an eye on the cash-burn for this reported quarter though as debt levels are at an all-time high. It's been an abysmal year for some in the EV space. Fisker (FSR) is no exception. We touched on the options flow in LCID last week. Here too options flows are less than sanguine, and likely for the same reasons. FSR reported $470mm cash on hand for the quarter ended June 30th, and the Street's expectation was that provided four to five quarters worth of runway at the burn rate they've been experiencing. Unsurprising then that the January $3 puts traded over 22,000 contracts on Wednesday including a purchase of more than 10k for $1.25/contract — more than 40% of the strike price. These types of put purchases are frequently the type of activity one sees when companies begin to make \"ability to continue as a going concern\" types of statements and disclaimers. Fisker has attempted, after an earlier run as a car maker foundered, to run a more \"asset light\" business, but still that negative free cash flow needs to get under control. Home Depot (HD) is a holding of ours and at 18.5 times forward earnings estimates it's trading at a discount to its own historical valuation which is closer to 20 times over the past two years. HD and Lowe's both saw meaningful boosts to their business during the pandemic as home improvement took off. Where Home Depot differs from Lowe's is sales to professionals/contractors, which represents 40% of their business. Admittedly, high mortgage rates are a bit of a concern on that front, while rising signs of pressures on consumer finances could also crimp sales growth as consumers increasingly hold off on purchases of big ticket items, such as appliances, particularly. Excluding options that expired this past Friday, the most active contracts this past week were puts, although not every put that trades is a bearish bet. For example, an institutional trader sold 1200 January $225 puts at 50 cents. A put seller is willing to get long the stock at the put strike in the event the stock price declines below that level — essentially they are selling insurance to other investors who are betting on a potential decline. I like the strategy generally, selling puts to collect premium on stocks one hopes to own at lower prices. Considering we own it we must like it at the current price. At $225, a more than 20% discount to Friday's close, it would be even more appealing. That said I do not favor selling options for less than 1% of the strike price in terms of monthly premium collected, and I usually favor selling options between catalysts such as earnings, even though options premiums tend to be a bit lower. So if you hold the stock, maybe wait until after earnings to sell covered calls, and if you don't, wait until after earnings to sell cash covered puts. Target (TGT) is another company that has traded very poorly year-to-date and is trading at an enormous discount to its historical valuation, and at just 12.7 times forward earnings, a huge discount to peers such as Walmart (WMT). Given we own both I suppose one might suggest we have a big of a barbell approach. Target always felt like an upmarket, and more approachably scaled store when compared to Walmart. Walmart has gotten credit for expanding into grocery, which Target has also been attempting, albeit on a far more limited scale. One of Target's larger missteps was their LGBTQ Pride merchandise offerings which prompted calls for a boycott, which data suggests did prompt some market-share losses. My expectation is that those setbacks are likely temporary, and this likely provides an opportunity to pick up the shares at a discount. Options markets are on edge, the 7.7% earnings-related implied move reflects considerably greater uncertainty than the less than 4% implied move in Walmart for example. An institutional trader paid 76 cents for 1,000 Target November $120 calls on Friday, a level just under the 100-day moving average (in blue on the chart below). Personally, I might consider a call spread for a trade such as the November $110/$120 if we didn't already own the stock. The $120s would require a move even larger than the well above average one the options market implies. Of course the trader is risking only 0.7% of Friday's closing price, but the trade is a low probability bet. Finally, another holding of ours, Applied Materials (AMAT) will be reporting after the close on the Thursday. We saw decent activity in the November $157.50 calls, however earnings were most likely not the catalyst that prompted the bullish activity. Taiwan Semiconductor posted very strong October revenues, and AMAT rose 5% on that news. In fact, the stock is now up $20 a share since October 25th. Options premiums are very reasonable here in my view, particularly for those not inclined to chase it after such a strong rally. It was less than 17 times full year estimated earnings only 2 weeks ago, and is over 19times now. Perhaps, that is why the trader elected to purchase calls rather than the stock at these levels.

        "description": "Research has consistently shown that the relationship between diversity on executive teams and the likelihood of financial outperformance has strengthened over time.",
        "content": "The Phocuswright Conference is all about igniting solutions and collaboration among global travel leaders and innovators.\nSo it's natural that when the event kicks off Monday at the Diplomat Beach Resort in Hollywood, Florida, one of the first sessions would focus on a topic that's a concern for every business: diversity in leadership.\nResearch by the global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company has consistently shown that the relationship between diversity on executive teams and the likelihood of financial outperformance has strengthened over time. And while travel companies have been making great strides in that direction, it's clear no one has all the answers.\nGet a dose of digital travel in your inbox each day Subscribe to our newsletter below Submit I accept the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy\nThe afternoon session will bring together diversity advocates to share DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — initiatives they have implemented in their organizations.\nHosting the session is Kimberly Newbury, vice president of sales at Phocuswright.\n'We know this is an important issue for all companies, and we know that an inclusive culture is increasingly a competitive advantage,' she said. 'We do this work because we are in a unique position to be able to bring senior executives and industry leaders together to share initiatives they have implemented in their organizations — and across the industry — to address issues related to diversity and inclusion. Our purpose for this of initiative is to showcase DEI initiatives that work and to foster communication and implementation of projects that will benefit all of us.'\nThe session includes a panel discussion with Newbury; Melissa Maher, CEO and founder of Pinnacle Enterprises Group; Yvonne Drayton, director of operations for Tourism Diversity Matters; and Jessica Patel, senior vice president at TripArc.\nTo get more insight into the topic, PhocusWire queried some of the diversity advocates taking part in the program. Here are some highlights from their responses.\nHow diversity of thinking can lead to action\nMelissa Jurkoic is the chief experience office at Thynk, a hospitality technology provider. She said true innovation — or real change — doesn't happen where diversity doesn't exist.\n'I have been in rooms with people who don't challenge each other and in rooms where there is conflict and passion. I promise you the best ideas came from the rooms where people did not all agree. It's not just as simple as throwing different people in a room and innovation is born. It's also not just about the dimensions of diversity — race, gender, age, etc. — as an ingredient. It's the diversity of thought that matters. You need a group that won't accept ‘we've always done it this way,' and embrace out-of-the-box thinking. These two things sprinkled with a healthy dose of conflict create the environment to do things differently and breeds innovation.'\nFostering conversations that lead to progress means bringing together people who won't necessarily agree, at least at first.\n'We need to ensure the conversations are not just isolated safe spaces because, just like innovation requires diverse perspectives, so does real change. If we could do this in segregated groups of like people sharing the same dimension of diversity, then there would not be a problem to solve. What we can truly do better is raise the level of action to meet the level of conversation we have been having for decades on this topic. Let's take action.'\nThe importance of taking measure of DEIB goals\nDemi Horvat is the CEO at AirDNA, a data and analytics company that tracks short-term vacation rental data. Her company refers to their policies as DEIB – for diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.\nThe company made the decision early on that DEIB was a strategic priority, so it developed five-year and one-year goals while making commitments to initiatives to help attain those goals.\nA sampling of those initiatives:\nUnconscious bias training\nEquitable interview training\nAudit of job descriptions for inclusive language\nA process to diversify the talent pipeline to ensure all roles have diverse candidates\nCreation of a DEIB committee\nCreation of an apprentice program to create a path into the engineering and product teams for individuals with non-traditional backgrounds\nIt wasn't enough just to put in place policies that sounded good on paper, Horvat said. 'We wanted to ensure that the efforts we took produced results we could celebrate versus checking a box without actually driving positive change.'\nNo surprise then that the company developed key performance indicators to gauge its progress.\n'As a data business, we're strong believers in ‘You can't improve what you don't measure,' so it was important to us for those initiatives and long-term goals to be measured so that we could hold ourselves accountable,' she said.\nAmong the KPIs:\nAirDNA conducts an employee satisfaction survey twice a year that includes a set of questions around DEIB. After measuring a baseline, the company set public goals for improvements to those scores each year.\nThe company also set a baseline for the team's composition and committed to improving things like gender balance in leadership roles and on technical teams as well as representation of individuals who identify as BIPOC.\n'At AirDNA, measuring our impact and holding ourselves accountable has been the key to ensuring we're driving real impact versus ‘feel good' initiatives,' she said.\nParallels between the empowerment of travel and DEI initiatives\nAfter being stranded in Morocco in the early days of the pandemic, Vanessa Karel found herself wishing for a service that could help women navigate their global adventures with greater peace of mind.\n'I experienced a lot of scary and unfortunate situations,' she recalled. 'These instances lead to a lot of women not wanting to travel solo or unaccompanied.'\nFrom that experience, in 2021 Karel founded Greether, a travel marketplace that connects solo women travelers with female 'Greeters,' who help them book and navigate their journeys. She's already seen the impact the service can have on clients.\n'It makes them feel capable of experiencing joy on their own, feeling independent, giving them confidence and literally empowering them,' said Karel, who is also Greether's CEO. 'We have so many stories to share, from senior women who really wanted to see Paris but didn't have someone to go with them, to one of our first angel investors who decided to invest after her very first trip and realizing that our services mean open doors to countries that she didn't feel confident to go to before.'\nWhat does any of that have to do with DEI? Just as travelers can feel empowered by their far-flung adventures, employees can feel free to speak up and share ideas when they're in an environment that values diversity, equity and inclusion. Only then, Karel believes, can the most creative thinking occur — just as it did for her in Morocco.\n'Think about how when something goes wrong in life, you think of ways to never have that occur to you again,' she said. 'It might be a weird analogy, but the same thing happens with diversity and inclusion — different people and backgrounds in your team opens you up to opportunities to tackle challenges differently, to acknowledge the privileges or disadvantages that you constantly face. It allows you as a leader to see the world with a fresh pair of eyes and connect on a human level.'",

        "content": "Wynn Resorts (WYNN) posted a better-than-expected third quarter on Thursday, with both revenues and profits bolstered by the continued strength of its Las Vegas operations and the post-Covid rebound in Chinese gambling hub Macao. But investor concerns over an unevenness to the Macao recovery sparked selling in afterhours trading, sending Wynn stock down more than 5% — and creating a potential buying opportunity. Operating revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 increased 88% year-over-year, to $1.67 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $1.59 billion, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) came in at 99 cents, outpacing the 75-cent consensus estimate, LSEG data showed. Adjusted property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs (EBITDAR) — Wynn's key metric for profitability — climbed 206% year-over-year, to $530.4 million, well ahead of analysts' predictions of $488 million, according to FactSet. Bottom line Overall, Wynn delivered strong third-quarter results. Its two Macao properties are now generating 85% of 2019 levels and on a path toward full recovery, even if Wynn Macao is taking longer to recover than Wynn Palace. But we remain confident that management has the right playbook to stem any potential market-share loss at its one struggling property in China. Meanwhile, Wynn's Las Vegas property remains on fire, tracking to earn about double this year than what it did in 2019, with no signs of a let-up from its high-end customers. The Boston property showed some softness and could be topping out, but we're encouraged by management's plans to expand its footprint in the city in the near future. At the same time, the market is likely overlooking the not-yet-operational Wynn Al Marjan project in the United Arab Emirates, which broke ground this year. The company continues to see this as an exciting opportunity. Despite these positives, Thursday evening's sell-off brought Wynn stock to about $40 below the level at which was trading in 2019. While we understand how macroeconomic concerns about China are weighing on the stock, the company's properties in the country continue to perform — and at a higher margin than in prior years. With the stock trading at about 10-times its 2023 enterprise value to EBITDAR, a roughly two-times discount to its 2019 multiple, we think the stock is too cheap at these prices. And our plan is to seize the opportunity to add to our Wynn position on Friday morning. Quarterly commentary Macao The recovery at Wynn's properties in China's special administrative region of Macao continued with a total EBITDAR of $255 million, representing 85% of Wynn's pre-Covid levels in the casino hub. However, the company's two properties in the region – Wynn Palace and Wynn Macao – are not enjoying an equal pace of recovery. The results at Wynn Palace were robust and the property is firmly on track to return to pre-pandemic profit levels. In 2019, Wynn Palace generated $730 million in EBITDAR. The $177 million in EBITDAR the property generated last quarter at an annualized rate results in roughly $708 million, showing Wynn is back on track. At the same time, the third-quarter margins reported Thursday came in higher than that of 2019, a sign of strong leverage. Wynn Palace last quarter generated $177 million in EBITDAR , which is more than the $162 million earned in 2019 despite less operating revenue. Unfortunately, the recovery at Wynn Macao has been more checkered. That's partly a result of closures related to renovations. There's also the structural issue of Wynn relying too heavily on press junket and VIP customers at the expense of premium mass customers, who are now dominating the gambling space in Macao. In the third quarter of 2023, Wynn Macao generated about $78 million in profits, which when annualized is only $312 million. In 2019, the property earned a total of $649 million in profits, including $139 million in the third quarter. The weakness at Wynn Macao has the market concerned Thursday about a loss of market share. But CEO Craig Billings argued on the company's post-earnings conference call that Wynn can hold share without junkets at a structurally higher margin due to the costs taken out during the pandemic. Las Vegas Even against a tough year-over-year comparison, EBITDAR at Wynn's Las Vegas property increased 12%, to a new third-quarter record of about $220 million. Management also noted that its top-line trends in Las Vegas have continued to be strong through October, with \"healthy\" gross gaming revenue and strong RevPar (revenue per available room) growth. The company continues to point to high-profile events like the upcoming Formula 1 Grand Prix and NFL Superbowl as part of a pipeline generating strong forward group demand. For the former event, the company said it expects to exceed its all-time hotel revenue record by about 50% for the three-day period beginning Nov. 17. Encore Boston Harbor Wynn's Boston property proved relatively stable, even if disappointing with EBITDAR of $60 million coming in about 1% lower on the year prior. Wynn blamed some of the decline to construction of a major tunnel near the property, but the company said it's feeling the same macroeconomic pressures as other regional operators. Still, Wynn said its Boston business accelerated in October with month-over-month growth in slot handle, table drop and strong growth in RevPar. Wynn Interactive The company continues to take a disciplined cost approach to its digital gaming platform, focusing only on U.S. states where it has a physical presence. As a result, Wynn saw its \"burn rate,\" or losses, improve sequentially to $5 million, down from $15 million in the second quarter. Balance sheet Wynn said Thursday it had repurchased $56.2 million worth of shares in the third quarter, at an average price $94.11 each. It's a small figure but worth noting given the company did not buy back any stock in the second quarter. When a company that does not regularly repurchase stock makes such a move, it's generally a sign of confidence in the future and a dislocation in the market. In this case, management explained tonight that it will buy back stock when it's \"mispriced as we believe it has been.\" Wynn announced the resumption of a dividend earlier this year, paying out 25 cents per share quarterly.

        "content": "DuPont de Nemours (DD) delivered a decent third quarter Wednesday, even as the company's lowered outlook for the full year weighed on its stock. But we remain optimistic the specialty chemicals company's electronics business will turn next year, leading to revived growth. Net sales for the three months ended Sept. 30 declined roughly 8% year-over-year, to $3.06 billion, missing analysts' expectations of $3.15 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) of 92 cents exceeded the LSEG estimate of 84 cents a share, growing 12% year-over-year. Shares of DuPont closed down more than 8% Wednesday, at $66.95 apiece. Bottom line DuPont's quarter was more or less in line with Wall Street's expectations, even as the company's guidance disappointed investors. But taking the longer-term view, there are positive signs that the company's electronics and industrial business is bottoming, with green shoots materializing on stabilizing sales at the semiconductor technologies subunit and sequential improvement at the interconnect solutions subunit. However, management's expectation for consumer-electronics demand in the fourth quarter to be similar to that of the third, with some sequential growth in semiconductor technologies, was a disappointment as we expected demand to pick up sooner. DuPont is pointing to a 2024 recovery, driven by growth in PC and smartphone shipments, as well as increasing demand for both artificial-intelligence and traditional servers. \"In general, demand for high-performance and high-density memory chips is accelerating, supported by AI growth, as well as overall growth for new mobile product launches. This directly correlates with DuPont's product strengths within the semiconductor and consumer electronics markets\" CEO Ed Breen said on DuPont's post-earnings conference call Wednesday. Crucially, DuPont typically outperforms growth in the broader semiconductor industry by 200 to 300 basis points because of its exposure to high-end chips. So if the industry can grow in the mid-to-high single digits next year, DuPont's business will grow even faster than that as it expands its margins through increased volume. That's what attracted us to DuPont in the first place. It's an inexpensive way to play the return to growth in the semiconductor-and-electronics industry, which historically has been viewed as a steady grower. But it's taking an extra quarter than the market had anticipated, generating the post-earnings selling pressure. At the same time, DuPont raised concerns about its water and safety solutions business due to ongoing destocking and a weaker China. It was concerning to see this business flip negative after reporting 1% organic growth in the second quarter, but the water industry in general has historically grown by mid-single digits and it should return to that range in due course. Clearly, DuPont isn't firing on all cylinders, with revenues down versus last year and its largest end market —electronics — in the bottoming process. But the stock isn't priced for that, trading at roughly 16-times 2024 EPS estimates. We think that's too cheap of a multiple for a business that's troughing, which is why Wednesday's sell-off is a buying opportunity. Quarterly commentary Revenue at DuPont's electronics and industrial business — which makes differentiated materials and component solutions for high-performance computing, 5G, electric vehicles, and consumer electronics like smartphones and PCs — declined 9% year-over-year. The segment's 13% decline in organic sales was partially offset by a 4% boost from its $1.75 billion acquisition of Spectrum Plastics Group. The electronics and industrial segment is comprised of three subunits: semiconductor technologies, interconnect solutions and industrial solutions. Sales at the semiconductor technologies business were down by a high-teens percentage, due to continued inventory destocking and reduced semiconductor fab utilization rates, which is another way of saying output. Sales stabilized from the second quarter, but should improve in the quarters ahead as fab utilization rates increase to around 80% next year and 90% in 2025, compared with 70% currently, according to industry estimates DuPont shared. Sales at the interconnect solutions business were down 11% year-over-year, mainly due to lower volumes of consumer electronics. But an 8% sales improvement on the second quarter was encouraging. This was the second-straight quarter of sequential sales growth for the unit, a clear sign the business is bottoming. Lastly, sales at the industrial solutions business fell by a high-single-digit percentage, due to channel inventory destocking with biopharmaceutical markets and lower electronics demand. But that was partially offset by increased demand for OLED lighting materials. The electronics and industrial segment delivered third-quarter operating margins of just 28%. But the company expects the segment to return to margins around 32% as volumes recover. Meanwhile, the water and protection segment saw revenue fall 8% year-over-year, with an 9% decline in volumes offset by a 1% increase in prices. Sales at the safety solutions and shelter solutions subunits both fell by high-single-digit percentages, with the former impacted by channel inventory destocking and the latter weighed down by soft demand in construction markets. The water solutions subunit proved a surprise, with revenues dropping by a mid-single-digit percentage on lower volumes due to distributor inventory destocking and weaker industrial demand in China. Despite the year-over-year sales decline, the water and protection segment's operating margins for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization increased 70 basis points on an annual basis, to 25.6% DuPont completed a $3.25 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program in September and then launched a new $2 billion ASR, which the company expects to complete in the first quarter of 2024. The combination of these two programs drove a 15% reduction in DuPont's outstanding share count. The company said Wednesday that it expects to incrementally repurchase stock in 2024 using a portion of excess cash. Guidance DuPont shaved its full-year net sales outlook to about $12.17 billion, from a previous range of $12.45 billion to $12.55 billion. That implies fourth-quarter sales of $3.04 billion, which come in below analysts' estimates of $3.17 billion. The company expects full-year operating EBITDA to be about $2.98 billion, which is at the low end of management's prior range of $2.98 billion to $3.03 billion. The revised figure implies fourth-quarter EBITDA of $748 million, which falls short of estimates of $775 million. DuPont narrowed its adjusted EPS for the full year to around $3.45, from a previous range of $3.40 to $3.50 a share. That implies fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of 84 cents versus estimates of 91 cents. The company cited additional channel inventory destocking and slow industrial demand in China, mostly in its water solutions business, for its revised guidance.

Profit margin performance was also well ahead of expectations, driving better-than-expected operating income results Bottom line While some investors seem concerned that the company has reached peak profit margins and a declining backlog of orders for its products going into 2024, we've seen this kind of rush to judgment before. We are impressed with the quarterly numbers, and are eyeing a stock price of $225 as a good place to step in to buy more shares. Shares of CAT were down nearly 6% midday Tuesday to roughly $228. It's true the operating margin is expected to contract a bit from Tuesday's results. That's in line with Wall Street forecasts but the contraction comes from a higher level than previously forecast. To us, this indicates the guidance may be conservative. The backlog decline also comes as no surprise. In our second-quarter analysis , we noted that a decline on the back of supply chain improvements is not cause for concern, especially with demand remaining healthy. Still, investors are concerned about 2024: The first question on Caterpillar's conference call with analysts was about the potential for near-term growth. CEO James Umpleby was quick to call out his expectation for \"another good year\" in 2024. He added that Caterpillar has already seen \"some benefit\" from the U.S.'s spending on infrastructure projects and that he expects to see even more next year and beyond. We see nothing here to change our positive outlook on Caterpillar. The sell-off Tuesday isn't warranted, though it is in line with what we've seen the entire earnings season as investors focus on anything even slightly negative as a basis for selling stocks. As a result, we reiterate our $300 price target and are upgrading shares to a 1 rating. Quarterly results While segment results were a bit mixed versus expectations, all three of its main businesses demonstrated healthy sales growth versus the year-ago period. In addition, all three of Caterpillar's physical product segments put up solid operating income growth. On the call, the management team noted that the operating margin strength came as a result of lower-than-expected manufacturing costs, including freight as well as the company's ability to charge slightly higher prices for its equipment. Construction industries sales in the third quarter rose 12% to $7 billion. North America sales were up 31% on an increase in both volume and prices. Umpleby explained that demand remained healthy for nonresidential and residential construction and that nonresidential continued to benefit from government-related infrastructure and construction projects. Latin America sales fell 31% due to lower sales volume that was only partially offset by higher prices. In Europe, Africa and the Middle East, sales were up 8% due to price increases and tailwind from currency dynamics. Sales in its Asia/Pacific segment were down 8% versus the year-ago period on lower sales volume. China is expected to remain weak in the near term. Outside of China, management expects growth thanks to public infrastructure spending and the support of commodity prices. Resource industries sales of $3.35 billion increased by 9%. Segment sales benefited from higher prices that were offset by a decline in sales volume. Higher prices also aided profitability, despite the dual headwinds of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix. Energy and transportation sales increased 11% to $6.86 billion. Segment profit benefited from higher prices and sales volume, though this was partially offset by higher SG & A and R & D expenses, an increase in manufacturing costs, and a currency headwind. Backlog commentary Caterpillar's order backlog was down $2.6 billion sequentially and $1.9 billion versus the year-ago period. Umpleby had this to say about the backlog, which has been a focus of investors: \"Backlog is a function of demand and lead times. As I've mentioned, demand remains healthy in most of our end markets. Due time proving supply chain conditions, product availability and lead times have improved for many products. Dealers and customers can wait longer to place orders which has led to a moderation in order rates as expected.\" He added that the company's backlog still remains elevated as a percentage of revenues compared to historic levels. Dealer inventories, another forward-looking metric to monitor, increased by about $600 million on a sequential basis driven by strength in construction industries. Caterpillar dealers are independent businesses and are unlikely to increase inventory levels unless they see strong demand continuing. Guidance Management said fourth-quarter sales are expected to be \"slightly higher\" on an annual basis as pricing remains a tailwind. What slightly higher means exactly is open to interpretation. It's safe to say many investors are questioning if it will be enough to achieve the expected 5.1% annual growth. Dealer inventories are expected to decline as Caterpillar does not expect the seasonal sales increase typically seen from the third to the fourth quarter. But it does still expect dealer inventory in construction industries will be higher at the end of 2023 than it was at the year-end 2022. The adjusted operating profit margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be lower versus the third quarter result. Though we didn't get an exact number, directionally, that's in line with the 17.8% consensus expectation for the fourth quarter. On a full-year basis, Umpleby he expects 2023 to be better than anticipated during the company's last earnings call. Regarding profitability, management expects Caterpillar's the adjusted operating margin to be \"slightly above the target range relative to the corresponding expected level sales.\" As a reminder, Caterpillar provides a chart within its slide deck (page 16) that offers an expected adjusted operating profit margin range given a level of sales. Coming in to Tuesday's results, the consensus estimate on Wall Street was for full-year sales of $67 billion with an adjusted operating profit margin of 19.3%. To hit $67 billion, we need to see fourth-quarter sales increase by at least $420 million, or 2.5%. All told, we believe the operating margin consensus on Wall Street needs an upward revision. For 2023 cash flow, the team now expects machinery, energy & transportation (ME & T) to exceed the $4 billion to $8 billion range previously provided. That's better than the \"around the top\" commentary we got last quarter. As a reminder, management intends to \"return substantially all\" ME & T free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases over time. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CAT.

        "description": "The case for owning Eli Lilly got stronger Thursday, as diabetes drug Mounjaro crossed $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time.",
        "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) issued strong quarterly results Thursday — fueled by blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro — that validated the stock's big run and amplified hopes that it's not done yet. Revenue in the third quarter totaled $9.5 billion, topping the $8.95 billion expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Adjusted earnings per share were 10 cents in the three months ended Sept. 30, exceeding the 13-cent loss projected by analysts, LSEG data showed. LLY YTD mountain Eli Lilly's year-to-date stock performance. Investors are understandably cheering the results, sending Eli Lilly shares higher by more than 4%. Even after its nearly 60% ascent this year, additional gains in the stock appear likely. Bottom line The case for owning Eli Lilly got stronger Thursday. \"Eli Lilly today is beginning its next leg of going up,\" Jim Cramer said during Thursday's Morning Meeting . The most important line item was Mounjaro sales, which cleared Wall Street's high bar. The type-2 diabetes drug, with promise to also treat obesity, soared above the $1 billion mark in quarterly revenue for the first time. \"You have to wonder what number they could've done if they had been able to get it for customers,\" Jim said, alluding to Mounjaro supply shortages that Eli Lilly experienced in the quarter amid fervent demand for the drug. On Thursday, Eli Lilly offered encouraging commentary around increasing Mounjaro manufacturing capacity ahead of its expected approval by U.S. regulators for weight loss. The Food and Drug Administration should issue that decision by year-end, Eli Lilly reiterated Thursday. The FDA approved Mounjaro for diabetes in May 2022. Jim has long said Mounjaro will become the best-selling drug of all time — a viewpoint he emphasized again Thursday — and securing obesity approval is necessary for that to happen. When given the green light as an obesity treatment, Mounjaro will compete with Novo Nordisk 's (NVO) Wegovy. It's already up against Novo's Ozempic in diabetes. On the other hand, the FDA's decision on Lilly's experimental Alzheimer's therapy , known as donanemab, should now come in the first quarter of 2024, the company said Thursday. Previously, Lilly expected an answer by the end of 2023. Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's efforts are also part of our investment thesis, but to a lesser extent than Mounjaro. We're not concerned about the delayed timeline for potential approval. In a CNBC interview , Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said Thursday the FDA needed more time to review all the data on donanemab. \"It's a big package — one of the biggest ones we've ever submitted. ... No concerns about that, just more of the procedure is taking a little longer from their end,\" Ricks said. We're also looking past the noise around Eli Lilly's EPS in the third quarter, and the company's lowered full-year profit outlook. Usually, those would be troubling developments — but in this instance, the reason is tied to accounting rules about acquisitions. It's unsurprising given the buying spree Lilly has been on lately . Right now, the growth of Mounjaro revenue is what matters most for Eli Lilly's stock — and on this metric, the company delivered and offered assurances that there's still plenty more ahead. Quarterly commentary Eli Lilly's overall sales topped expectations, though the year-over-year growth rate of 37% is a bit skewed by a $1.42 billion contribution from the sale of commercial rights for antipsychotic medication Zyprexa. Excluding that divestiture and the $387 million in Covid antibody sales in the year-ago quarter, Eli Lilly's sales grew 24% on an annual basis — a highly respectable figure. Mounjaro yet again was Eli Lilly's No. 2 drug in the quarter, with revenue totaling $1.41 billion, ahead of the $1.28 billion expected by analysts and up 44% compared with the second quarter. We're making a quarter-over-quarter comparison here because the drug was just ramping up in the year-ago period. Management said on the call that Eli Lilly remains on track to double manufacturing capacity for Mounjaro by year-end, as production is underway at a large manufacturing site in North Carolina's Research Park Triangle area. Additionally, another manufacturing facility a few hours away in Concord, North Carolina, is scheduled to come online in 2024, Ricks said. U.S. supplies of Mounjaro have improved, management said. All doses of the drug are currently listed as available on an FDA website that tracks shortages, the company noted. Mounjaro supply remains tight outside the U.S. \"This is really all hands on deck,\" Ricks said. \"We are not at all happy with the capacity we've announced already. You'll see more,\" the CEO added, noting the company is working on additional methods of delivering the injectable drug that should allow for additional production. Fellow diabetes treatment Trulicity was still Lilly's best-seller in Q3. But even at over $1.67 billion, Trulicity revenue missed estimates and fell 12% quarter over quarter and dropped more than 9.5% from the year-ago period. The company said that more people in the U.S. were taking Trulicity, but the money Lilly earned on each prescription was lower due to factors including rebates and discounts. Outside the U.S., Trulicity was impacted by supply shortages. In fact, Lilly CFO Anat Ashkenazi said doctors have been told to refrain from starting new patients on the drug to ensure that people who have already been taking it don't see disruptions. Third-quarter sales of diabetes pill Jardiance — another key growth product for Lilly — came in a bit lighter than expectations at nearly $701 million. Analysts had been looking for sales of $765 million. In September, the FDA expanded Jardiance's label to include the treatment of chronic kidney disease. Guidance Eli Lilly expects full-year EPS of between $6.50 and $6.70 on an adjusted basis, down from its prior outlook of $9.70 to $9.90. The change reflects Lilly's recent string of acquisitions, which in the third quarter alone included Dice Therapeutics, Versanis Bio, and Emergence Therapeutics. The adjustment is a matter of accounting, not cause for concern as mentioned earlier, especially because those deals are intended to power additional revenue growth down the road. Lilly left its full-year sales outlook unchanged in the range of $33.4 billion and $33.9 billion. The Indianapolis-based pharmaceuticals giant maintained full-year gross margin guidance of approximately 80%. However, on the earnings call, Ashkenazi said the company is \"trending toward the higher end of the estimate.\" Similarly, Eli Lilly is on pace to be at the top end of its guidance for research and development (R & D) spending, as well as marketing, selling and administrative expenses. Lilly is guiding for $8.9 billion to $9.1 billion in R & D expenses and between $7.2 billion and $7.4 billion in marketing, selling and administrative expenses. In the case of expenses, lower is generally better — but Lilly right now is spending to support clinical trials and multiple upcoming drug launches, so it's not too worrisome to see the company heading toward the top of those expense ranges.

        "description": "Eli Lilly (LLY) remains our favorite way to play the weight-loss drug market, despite a new entry this week from AstraZeneca (AZN). On Thursday,",
        "content": "Eli Lilly (LLY) remains our favorite way to play the weight-loss drug market, despite a new entry this week from AstraZeneca (AZN). On Thursday, AstraZeneca said it paid $185 million upfront to acquire the rights to an experimental weight-loss pill from Eccogene, a Chinese biotech startup. AstraZeneca hopes to begin two mid-stage trials for the drug, known as ECC5004, by the end of 2024, investigating its efficacy in treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes, respectively. Additional competition for Eli Lilly is to be expected, considering how lucrative the market expected to be. Sales forecasts on Wall Street vary, but multiple analysts now project obesity drugs to generate at least $100 billion in annual revenue down the road. However, Eli Lilly may have a first-mover advantage. Its obesity pill is much further along in development than ECC5004, though both figure to be years away from actually hitting the market. 'The company that already has something approved is far more likely to get a pill formulation approved than one that doesn't,' Jim Cramer said Friday. 'The incumbent almost always wins.' Eli Lilly shares had their worst day of the year Thursday, falling 4.5% in the session to close at $591.32. AstraZeneca's encroachment on turf currently dominated by Eli Lilly and Danish rival Novo Nordisk (NVO) may have contributed to Thursday's declines. But a bigger driver may have simply been profit-taking after U.S. regulators on Wednesday officially green-lit the Club holding's entrance into the obesity market. That approval, despite being widely expected, pushed Eli Lilly to an all-time closing high Wednesday, at $619.13 per share. Shares of Eli Lilly were up roughly 0.5% Friday, shaking off early morning declines. Friday's action comes ahead of a commercially significant data presentation this weekend from Novo Nordisk, which has the potential to lift its stock and shares of Eli Lilly . Jim said Friday investors should consider buying Eli Lilly ahead of that presentation at the American Heart Association conference. LLY 1Y mountain Eli Lilly's stock performance over the past 12 months. U.K.-based AstraZeneca's ECC5004 belongs to the same category as Eli Lilly's tirzepatide and Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, known as GLP-1s. Those are the active ingredients in Eli Lilly's diabetes treatment Mounjaro and recently approved weight-loss drug Zepbound, and Novo's Ozempic for diabetes and Wegoy for obesity. All four are injectable drugs. Interest in GLP-1 drugs has soared over the past year, creating supply shortages that both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are scrambling to alleviate with investments in additional manufacturing capacity. GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone in the gut — glucagon-like peptide 1 — to help control blood sugar and effectively suppresses appetite, which can lead to weight loss. Unlike Ozempic and Wegovy, Eli Lilly's tirzepatide targets a second gut hormone, abbreviated as GIP, which the company believes adds to the drug's effectiveness in weight loss. Eli Lilly's GLP-1 efforts are core to our investment thesis in the company, as their promise to treat obesity and deliver other health benefits, such as lower the risk of serious heart problems, should help fuel robust growth in the years ahead. Jim has repeatedly said Eli Lilly's tirzepatide — under the Mounjaro and Zepbound brands — will become the best-selling drug of all time. When asked about AstraZeneca's latest move on CNBC Thursday, Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said: 'On the one hand, if you're running a major pharmaceutical company, you have to pay attention to this category. It's probably malpractice not to consider investing in obesity given the opportunity ahead.' 'On the other hand, I think Lilly is a leader here, and we plan to make it hard to be caught,' Ricks said. Eli Lilly is well-equipped to handle new competition for a few reasons, including its significant investments in manufacturing capacity to help meet fervent demand; a key production site in North Carolina is online, with another one in the state scheduled to be finished next year. For its part, Novo Nordisk is working to boost Ozempic and Wegovy supply, with its CEO telling Reuters on Friday that it's upping investments in Denmark. Eli Lilly's GLP-1 pipeline also looks formidable, setting it up for commercial success beyond just Mounjaro and Zepbound. Mid-stage study results released in June showed that Eli Lilly's own weight-loss pill, orforglipron, was highly effective, and the company has initiated late-stage trials with it for obesity and Type 2 diabetes . Both studies are estimated to be complete in 2025, according to U.S. government website that tracks trials. In Thursday's CNBC interview, Ricks alluded to the fact orforglipron is further along in development than some other oral GP1-s, including AstraZeneca's ECC5004. However, an AstraZeneca executive on Thursday touted ECC5004 as having fewer side effects than other oral GLP-1s with 'efficacy on par with competitors in this class.' Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk has said it plans to submit its obesity pill to U.S. regulators by year-end. In general, pharmaceutical companies see oral GLP-1 drugs as a way to expand the obesity market , even if they don't generate as much weight loss as injectable versions like Wegovy and Zepbound. Eli Lilly has another experimental weight-loss drug called retatrutide that stands out for targeting a third hormone beyond just GLP-1 and GIP. A late-stage study for retatrutide began this year and is estimated to be completed in 2026 . Against this backdrop, we see Eli Lilly on solid footing as other pharmaceutical companies, like AstraZeneca, that are understandably making moves to compete in the GLP-1 market. And in its battle with Novo Nordisk, more specifically, there is ample room for both companies right now because obesity is such a nascent opportunity. Indeed, Citigroup analysts frame the Lilly-Novo debate as one of 'market-creation,' rather than 'market-share.' They reiterated that longstanding view in a note to clients Friday, arguing Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk should enjoy a 'structural duopoly well into the next decade.' Our desire to own Eli Lilly over Novo Nordisk hinges, in part, on our confidence in Eli Lilly's other treatment opportunities, such as in Alzheimer's. Eli Lilly's leading drug candidate, donanemab, is awaiting U.S. regulatory approval in early 2024. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long LLY. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

        "content": "Ad The post-earnings decline in Humana (HUM) shares Wednesday was overdone, providing investors an opportunity to add to their positions in the Medicare Advantage-focused health insurer. The Club holding remains on solid ground after delivering a top- and bottom-line beat in the third quarter. Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 15.9% to $26.42 billion, topping analyst estimates of $25.55 billion, according to data provider LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $7.78 exceeded the consensus estimate of $7.16. Humana's companywide benefits expense ratio — also known as the medical loss ratio or MLR — came in at 86.4% in the quarter, below the 86.7% projected by analysts, according to FactSet. On this metric, lower is better. However, Humana's insurance segment MLR came in higher than expected, which was part of the reason for the stock decline. HUM YTD mountain Humana YTD Humana's quarter has some blemishes, but we see no reason to join the parade of sellers who are pushing the stock down more than 5% to under $500 per share. 'The story is on track, and I think you buy the stock,' Jim Cramer said during Wednesday's Morning Meeting . 'But you have to understand and respect sellers who are all trying to get out at once and don't even realize they've created an opportunity. It should no longer be sold down here. I would be a buyer of Humana at the end of the day.' Bottom line Ultimately, Humana's recent outperformance made the stock vulnerable to pullback on an imperfect report. Since its 2023 lows on July 13, Humana stock rallied more than 23% compared with a roughly 7% slide in the S & P 500 over the same stretch. More recently, Humana shares are up nearly 5% since Oct. 12 — the day before rival UnitedHealth Group ‘s (UNH) strong quarterly results — while the S & P 500 dropped 3.6%. We booked profits on our Humana position on Oct. 6, making good on our pledge to trim once the stock recovered to the $500-per-share level. One of the third-quarter blemishes: Humana experienced higher-than-anticipated medical costs in the period due to an increase in Covid-related hospital admissions, leading its medical loss ratio, or MLR, in that segment to come in above expectations. Given these recent trends, the company had to increase its full-year insurance MLR guidance to 87.5%, up from its prior target range of 86.3% to 87.3%. Quarterly commentary Investors have been concerned about medical costs for Humana and its insurance peers since June, when UnitedHealth first warned about a rise in elective procedures — and soon after, Humana said it was seeing similar trends. While second-quarter earnings assuaged the worst of Wall Street's fears , Humana's Q3 report Wednesday appears to have created some fresh jitters around medical costs, or utilization. The companywide benefits expense ratio of 86.4% can be seen on the quarterly earnings table. At the same time, CFO Susan Diamond offered helpful context around what changed in the third quarter, explaining that the company did not expect to see an uptick in Covid admissions until the final three months of the year. The company decided to be 'somewhat conservative' and leave its fourth-quarter Covid assumptions unchanged, Diamond said, despite the possibility that some of those costs were pulled forward into the third quarter. Humana has started to see Covid-related costs decline, Diamond said. Management's initial commentary on 2024 earnings and Medicare Advantage membership growth — discussed in more detail below — may also have left investors wanting. While these developments are not ideal, we think Humana also may be offering a conservative view on 2024. That is an understandable approach to take given it's still early in the enrollment cycle, and next year will be one of transition for the company. CEO Bruce Broussard, who has led the insurer for a decade, is set to retire in late 2024, the company announced in October. His replacement, health-care veteran Jim Rechtin, is slated to join Humana in January and work closely with Broussard on the leadership hand-off. Outlook Once again, Humana boosted its projections for 2023 individual Medicare Advantage membership growth — this time by 35,000 to approximately 860,000 members. That would mark a 19% increase compared with year-end enrollment levels in 2022. Humana's initial 2023 guidance — put forth a year ago — forecasted growth between 7.1% and 8.7%. Humana raised its full-year insurance segment MLR guidance to 87.5%, up from its prior target between 86.3% to 87.3%. For months, the company had said it expected to come in near the top of the old range, but the third-quarter medical cost trends prompted Wednesday's upward revision. Remember, on this metric, lower is better. Humana maintained its full-year adjusted EPS projection of at least $28.25 while lowering its EPS outlook on a generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP) basis. The company now expects GAAP EPS of at least $26.31, down from at least $26.91. Looking ahead to 2024, Humana expects its Medicare Advantage membership growth to be 'at or above industry growth level,' after significantly outperforming the industry in 2023. On the call, outgoing CEO Broussard said industry growth estimates vary for 2024, but offered a range between 6% to 8%. Humana also expects EPS growth in 2024 to fall on the lower end of its historical long-range 11%-to-15% target. Wall Street had been projecting around 13% EPS growth in 2024, according to FactSet. Capital allocation Humana still expects to buy back about $1.5 billion worth of stock in 2023, finance chief Diamond said on the earnings call. So far, repurchases have totaled roughly $1 billion, implying about $200 million worth of buybacks between August's earnings call and Wednesday's call. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long HUM.

        "content": "November may be just what the Wall Street doctor ordered for our portfolio stocks after the notoriously tough month of October lived up to its reputation. The S & P 500 dropped 2.2% in October — marking the index's first three-month losing streak since financial markets were jolted in the early days of the Covid pandemic. If history is any guide, though, stocks may be able to find their footing in November. On the first day of the new month, the major U.S. stock benchmarks posted strong gains as the Federal Reserve on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged for the second straight policy meeting. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 222 points, or 0.67%, while the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq rose 1% and 1.6%, respectively. Since 1950, the S & P 500 has climbed an average of 1.7% in November, the best average performance for any month of the year, according to the Stock Traders Almanac. April is the S & P 500's second-best month, with an average gain of 1.5%. December is third at 1.4%. .SPX ALL mountain The S & P 500's long-term performance. Keep in mind that seasonal trends have their limitations and should not serve as the basis for long-term investment decisions. It's possible current stock market considerations — such as corporate earnings, bond yields, fears of a broader Middle East conflict, and the Fed — could stand in the way of a November rally. Still, staying familiar with seasonal patterns can help contextualize near-term market moves as part of the broader 'buy and homework' that Jim Cramer advises anyone who owns individual stocks to engage in on a weekly basis. As a rule of thumb, Jim says one hour of homework per week is needed for each stock in investors' portfolios in order to keep up their holdings. Club stocks in November Following up on Wednesday's screen of October outperformers , we analyzed our portfolio using FactSet data to see how it fared recently during the historically strongest month of November. The answer: quite well. All but two of our stocks — Salesforce (CRM) and Coterra Energy (CTRA) — have had a positive average November performance since 2013. During that stretch, which mostly coincided with the longest bull market in history, the S & P 500 overall has had an average November gain of 3.2%, and it's been positive nine out of 10 times. The only monthly decline came in November 2021, when the S & P 500 fell 0.83%. In 2015, the broad U.S. equity index eked out a narrow gain of 0.05%. Leading the top November Club performers over the past decade are Foot Locker (FL) and Nvidia (NVDA), which have climbed an average of 9.45% and 9.39%, respectively, for the month since 2013. Foot Locker has been positive in seven of the past 10 Novembers while Nvidia has been in the green for eight of them. FL mountain 2017-12-01 Foot Locker since December 2017 To be sure, Foot Locker's standing is influenced in large part by a 42.4% surge in November 2017, the stock's third-best performance in any month of all time. On Nov. 17, 2017, shares of Foot Locker soared 28% following a strong-than-expected earnings report . Foot Locker also led our list of stocks that outperformed the market this October. However, shares are currently trading at $21 each — about half of what they were at the end of November 2017. We own Foot Locker as a turnaround story, though the clock is ticking . NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia YTD For its part, Nvidia has had some big November gains over the past decade. In fact, it's registered three Novembers with at least a 20% gain — in 2022, 2021 and 2016. Its worst November since 2013 came in 2018, when it sank 22.5%. While Nvidia around $418 per share is down roughly 17% from its all-time high in August, the stock is still up around 185% year to date. Rounding out the top five November Club performers are Morgan Stanley (MS), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Starbucks (SBUX), with average gains in the month of 7.87%, 7.13% and 7.04%, respectively. Palo Alto has been the most volatile of the trio, with a 50-50 split between positive and negative Novembers. PANW is up nearly 75% year to date. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley has been positive in eight of the past 10 Novembers, while and Starbucks has just one negative performance. The coffee giant's stock fell 1.9% in November 2015. For all of 2023, Morgan Stanley is down 15% and Starbucks is down nearly 8% compared to the S & P 500's 9% year-to-date increase. Note: Our list excludes Veralto (VLTO) and GE Healthcare (GEHC) because those two companies only became public in 2023. The steadiest Club stock in November over the past decade has been Costco Wholesale (COST), which has been positive in the month every year from 2013 onward — one of just 14 stocks in the S & P 500 to accomplish the feat, according to an analysis of FactSet data. In fact, the last time shares of Costco finished a November in the red was 2008 during the financial crisis. Coterra and Salesforce are the worst-performing Club stocks over the past 10 Novembers. During that stretch, Coterra has declined on average 2.74% in the month, dragged down by three separate Novembers in which the stock fell double-digits on a percentage basis. It's been positive in just four of the past 10 Novembers. Salesforce, meanwhile, is narrowly in the red, with an average November decline of just 0.1% since 2013. Like Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce has a 50-50 split between positive and negative Novembers over the past decade. Bottom line Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It's a common disclaimer in the investment community that's worth emphasizing when discussing seasonal patterns. Indeed, the negativity ruling Wall Street lately doesn't just go away when the calendar page turns. However, our analysis of how our Club names have done in the past 10 Novembers does take into account prior trying times for investors such as the pandemic and Fed chief Jerome Powell's October 2018 remarks indicating, at the time, more rate hikes were needed. His comments roiled the markets and led to the 'Powell pivot' a few months later. We, of course, don't make long-term decisions based on historical trends, but we watch them as part of our homework to stay on top of the market and our individual names.

        "description": "Cash flow potential is also why we hang on and own Disney despite the challenges ahead.",
        "content": "Disney (DIS) reported better-than-expected fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter earnings, highlighted by a beat on Disney+ core subscriber additions and continued strength at theme parks — all welcome developments for investors. But we really liked the company's ability to generate cash. Revenue increased about 5% year-over-year to $21.24 billion, missing expectations of $21.33 billion, according to the consensus estimate compiled by LSEG, formerly named Refinitiv. Earnings-per-share increased more than 170% to 82 cents, beating the LSEG consensus forecast of 70 cents. DIS YTD mountain Disney YTD Disney CEO Bob Iger's emphasis on cost management — raising the company's targeted savings by more than 35% — and his recommendation to board members that they declare a dividend by calendar year-end were well received. Shares of Disney were trading 3% higher in after-hours trading. Bottom line This was Disney's last quarter of fiscal 2023 and the first for its new three-segment reporting structure: Entertainment , which includes streaming and media operations, Sports , which includes ESPN, and Experiences , which includes theme parks, hotels, cruise line, and merchandising. Overall, we'd characterize the quarter as mixed, though we liked the narrower losses in streaming and the continued strength in the theme parks. Everyone knows the linear television market is challenged, so that wasn't a surprise. However, we did not learn much in the way of strategic partnerships for ESPN and its TV business. It also remains to be seen if this quarter will be enough to fend off a potential challenge from activist investor Nelson Peltz, who is said to be considering seeking more than one board seat. Peltz's Trian is a major investor in Disney. What seems to be underappreciated here is Disney restoring itself as a cash-generating story. Through its cost savings initiative and continued growth in its underlying business, Disney said on the post-earnings call that it expects to generate roughly $8 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2024. That's a significant improvement from the nearly $5 billion it generated in fiscal 2023 and $6.7 billion analysts expected for 2024. Furthermore, you have to go all the way back to fiscal 2018 for the most recent year in which Disney generated that much cash. Disney was a $100+ stock back then. As long as the company can make good on its goals and prove that cash flow will continue to grow, we can make the case that the stock should finally start to grind its way closer to those levels. That potential is why we hang on and own Disney despite the challenges ahead. Quarterly Commentary Starting with the direct-to-consumer business (DTC), which increased fiscal Q4 revenue by 12% compared to the year-ago period, as seen in the Product Segments section of the above earnings table. DTC, housed in the Entertainment segment, saw quarterly narrow to $420 million from $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022 Q4. We were pleased to see Disney+ add nearly 7 million subscribers to its core base. We focus more on what's happening in the core markets, instead of Hotstar, since core is where most of the revenue of being generated. To that point, the average revenue per user (ARPU) from the core base was a positive surprise as well, slightly beating expectations thanks to pricing increases and higher advertising revenue, partially offset by the impact of a promotion the company ran this summer. Now that Disney has announced its plans to acquire the remaining stake in Hulu held by CNBC-parent Comcast (CMCSA), the company remains on track to create a unified one app experience domestically for Disney+ and Hulu. Disney expects numerous benefits from their integration into one app, including increased engagement, greater advertising opportunities, lower churn, and reduced customer acquisition costs, which should help overall margins. The company remains committed to its guidance of DTC reaching profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Losses in the DTC streaming business (which includes the DTC line of business in the Entertainment segment and ESPN+ within the Sports segment) totaled $387 million in fiscal Q4, an improvement from the $512 million of losses in the prior quarter. As for the broader linear TV industry, it's no secret that this industry has been challenged due to cord-cutting and advertisers increasing their presence on digital platforms. For the long term, Disney is committed to identifying the best strategic path for this business that would maximize shareholder value. But in the near term, the company is focused on delivering cost efficiencies while continuing to deliver high-quality content. On the conference call, Iger characterized the industry as \"a little stronger than we had expected\" and not as bad as it was. But he added it's still not back to its preferred levels. In the Experiences segment, Disney continues to see strong growth and increasing profits despite the difficult comparisons from last year and broader concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending. Experiences revenue in fiscal Q4 slightly missed but grew 12.5% from the same quarter last year but operating income was better. Experiences operating income grew by over 31% from the prior fiscal year and was 27% higher than in fiscal 2019. The company cited significant growth across all its international sites versus last year and ongoing strength in Disney Cruise Line, Disney Vacation Club, and Disneyland Resort. The operating results at Disney World were lower than last year yet remain well above pre-pandemic levels. In Sports , the demise of ESPN appears to be false as its domestic business grew revenue and operating income in both fiscal 2022 and 2023. Better yet, the worldwide leader in sports is attracting more eyeballs than it has in a long time with viewership at the highest in four years, especially in the key 18 to 49 demographic. Disney remains committed to creating ESPN as a standalone streaming platform in the future. Longer term goals The first noteworthy update Thursday evening is that Disney has made great progress toward improving its cost structure and unlocking efficiencies. To that end, Iger announced that the company is now on track to achieve roughly $7.5 billion in cost reductions, which is $2 billion more than it targeted earlier this year. We have to wonder if this number has the potential to be revised even higher once Hugh Johnston gets a hold of the financials. Johnston will take over as chief financial officer next month, ending an incredibly successful run as the CFO of PepsiCo. We also received positive updates in terms of capital allocation. Disney management said it will recommend to the board that it declare a dividend by the end of the year. Disney has made it clear that any new dividend will be small to begin with but will increase as earnings and free cash flow grow over time. Disney suspended its dividend during the height of the Covid pandemic in the spring of 2020 and has yet to reinstate it. Bringing a dividend back has been on Iger's checklist since his return as CEO, nearly one year ago, and it should be welcome news to the market, especially in the context of the recent stress put on the balance sheet through the agreement to acquire the remaining stake in Hulu for at least $8.61 billion. Iger also reiterated his more longer-term strategic initiatives, including turning the streaming business into a profitably growing business, building ESPN \"into the preeminent digital sports platform,\" improving the economics of the film studio, and \"turbocharging\" growth of the Experiences business.

        "description": "In this quick earnings recap of Club names that delivered last week, we're also giving our updated view on each stock.",
        "content": "We just made it through the busiest week of the third-quarter earnings season, which saw 30% of S & P 500 companies report. That deluge included 10 stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust, which is the portfolio we use for the CNBC Investing Club. Here's a quick recap of what each Club name delivered last week and our updated view on each stock. Tuesday, Oct. 24 DHR YTD mountain Danaher YTD Danaher (DHR): The bioprocessing and life sciences company reported an earnings beat but management's commentary was more important than the numbers given the inventory destocking challenges the company has faced. Overall, management's tone was mixed. But, we thought it tilted more positively than negatively. What stood out to us was Danaher's ability to meet its Bioprocessing expectations and put an end to the string of outlook cuts that have plagued the company. The order trend — which is a sign of future revenue — didn't exactly bottom yet, but management expressed confidence that this year will be the bottom. The Life Sciences guide down was a new wrinkle and something to monitor, but the main driver of the stock should be bioprocessing. As orders inflect sometime in the first half of 2024, we expect the stock will rebound and start working again. We were early to pull the trigger into Danaher's post-earnings decline but still think the stock has come down too much given its quality. We're reiterating our buy-equivalent 1 rating on the stock. MSFT YTD mountain Microsoft YTD Microsoft (MSFT): This was a fantastic quarter and the company proved itself to be the primary monetizer of artificial intelligence out of the mega-cap tech stocks. We were hoping for stable revenue growth at Azure, but the cloud computing business surprised everyone by accelerating to 29% year over year thanks to a three percentage point benefit from AI services. We were also pleased to see the More Personal Computing segment return to revenue growth after a stretch of weakness in the personal computer market. Usually, it's a point of contention during the conference call, but management's guidance was clean and above expectations despite calling for a gradual ramp-up of revenue from Microsoft 365 Copilot, which officially launches on Wednesday. We're reiterating our 1 rating . GOOGL YTD mountain Alphabet YTD Alphabet (GOOGL): The quarter from the Google parent was mixed . On one hand, we were pleased to see revenue growth acceleration and beats at Search and YouTube. But on the other hand, the miss on the Google Cloud and lack of margin improvement at the unit was a cause for concern. We always thought of Google Cloud as the upstart name in the Big 3, but Alphabet management's lack of explanation about what went wrong made it clear to us that the business ceded share to Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). For Alphabet to catch up in the AI race, it might be forced to invest more aggressively, creating an imbalance between revenue growth and expense growth. For this reason, we are looking to trim back this large position as it recoups some of its post-earnings losses. We're reiterating 2 rating. Wednesday, Oct. 25 META YTD mountain Meta Platforms YTD Meta Platforms (META): The social media giant delivered an impressive quarter as the application of AI tools led to better engagement and monetization rates, translating to accelerating revenue growth. On the cost side, CEO Mark Zuckerberg's \"year of efficiency\" led to discipline on expenses. Even though the quarter was great, the market placed all its focus on revenue guidance, which was wider than usual due to some volatility at the start of the current quarter. We thought management's commentary was conservative and the post-earnings selloff was excessive, which is why we upgraded the stock to our 1 rating on Oct. 26. We're reiterating 1 rating. VLTO YTD mountain Veralto YTD Veralto (VLTO): This quarter was fine and the company's guidance was actually a little better than expected despite some headwinds in China and on consumer goods volumes. As we explained last Thursday, the debate we face is whether to move on from this small position with a limited track record of operating as a public company to have extra cash to purchase other stocks we have more confidence in. Earlier this month, Danaher completed the spinoff of Veralto, a water quality and packaging quality company. As DHR shareholders, we received some VLTO shares. We're reiterating 2 rating on Veralto. Thursday, Oct. 27 LIN YTD mountain Linde YTD Linde (LIN): The industrial gas and engineering company's earnings report showcased how it is a consistent, double-digit percent earnings-per-share (EPS) grower with yet another beat and raise. Linde's model is pretty straightforward. Each year its profits grow from new projects coming online, pricing gains, cost, and productivity initiatives as the outstanding share count shrinks from buybacks. We reiterate our 2 rating but would be more opportunistic in the $360s. HON YTD mountain Honeywell YTD Honeywell (HON): We thought Honeywell's quarter was a little misunderstood. Was it perfect? No. Ongoing strength in its Aerospace business continues to be overshadowed by tepid growth in the Building Technologies and Performance Materials & Technologies units, as well as weakness in the Safety & Productivity Solutions division. The reasons why we are more upbeat about Honeywell's future than what the market is giving it credit for are because of the backlog, which ended the quarter at a new record, and the double-digit percentage growth in orders. We figured Aerospace orders would be robust, and it was up 30% year over year. But what stood out to us more was how Safety & Productivity Solutions and Building Technologies orders were flat year over year, a sign that these end markets have finally started to stabilize. We're reiterating 1 rating. AMZN YTD mountain Amazon YTD Amazon (AMZN): This was a fantastic quarter that checked a lot of boxes for us. Improving profitability was on display with operating margins in North America, expanding for its sixth straight quarter to its highest level since the third quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, the international retail business almost got back to breakeven. While AWS cloud revenue growth may not have accelerated as some optimistic bulls had hoped for, it stabilized. We were also impressed by how the cloud business added an incremental $919 million of revenue quarter to quarter with overall margins expanding to 30% for the first time in six quarters. We're reiterating 1 rating. F YTD mountain Ford YTD Ford (F): This was our most disappointing earnings report of the week as profits missed the market due to lower volumes and a $1.2 billion increase in warranty expenses. Furthermore, Ford's transition to electric vehicles has become more complicated due to waning demand and Tesla -induced pricing pressure. Due to the challenges that lie ahead, including much higher labor costs that were extracted during the UAW strike, this is one pullback we won't be buying and therefore. We're downgrading the stock to our 2 rating. Friday, Oct. 27 SWK YTD mountain Stanley Black & Decker YTD Stanley Black & Decker (SWK): This tool maker delivered a solid upside surprise as it continued to make progress on its inventory reduction and cost savings initiatives. The quarter gave us more confidence in the company's ability to drive its adjusted gross margins back to pre-Covid pandemic levels of about 35% from the current 28%. We're reiterating 1 rating.

        "description": "The stock dropped after management's December-quarter revenue guide was a bit lower than Wall Street expectations.",
        "content": "Club name Apple (AAPL) posted a better-than-expected September quarter after the closing bell Thursday, with strong Services sales more than offsetting a slight miss on the Products side. However, shares dropped in after-hours trading after management's December-quarter revenue guide was a bit lower than Wall Street expectations. Revenue in Apple's fiscal 2023 fourth quarter of $89.5 billion edged down 1% but edged out expectations of $89.3 billion. Foreign exchange fluctuations were a headwind of over 2 percentage points. Earnings per share of $1.46 rose 13% compared to a year ago and exceeded the LSEG consensus estimate of $1.39 per share. Gross margin of 45.2% was a September quarter record and slightly above the 44.5% estimate. AAPL YTD mountain Apple YTD Apple shares fell more than 3% after the release. In addition to a light revenue outlook, the tech giant's overall revenue as of the final quarter of fiscal 2023 fell for the fourth straight quarter. Remember, due to Apple's calendar, the company's upcoming December quarter is the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024. Bottom line Apple reported strong quarterly results to close out its fiscal year 2023. While Products sales were a bit short versus expectations, Services sales, which come with a much higher profit margin, were very strong with growth accelerating substantially versus the prior quarter. Gross income performance was better for both Products and Services. Sales guidance for the current quarter (the holiday quarter) came up shorter, however, as we've noted before, we think the installed user base – which hit another all-time high and stands at over 2 billion active devices and growing – and Services momentum should carry more weight with investors than any one quarter. Given what we heard Thursday, we aren't too concerned about the guide. If anything, should it hit the stock materially, it would provide the buying opportunity many investors are looking for as short-term weakness against the backdrop of longer-term strength built on sound fundamentals is how you get market opportunities. Furthermore, though the revenue guide was a bit light, the gross margin guide was very strong. It's not about what you make. It's what you keep — especially in a high-interest rate environment that forces investors to focus much more on earnings as a basis for valuation versus sales. Apple is very good at methodically increasing the lifetime value of its customers over time and we don't see that changing. As a result, we're reaffirming our \"own it, don't trade it\" view of the stock and reiterating our buy-equivalent 1 rating and $205 price target. With the current after-hours decline, the stock has dropped about 13% from its all-time high back in July, giving investors waiting for a chance to buy an opportunity. Cash and capital allocation In its September quarter, Apple generated operating cash flow and free cash flow results that were lower than what the Street was looking for. But that didn't stop Apple from returning nearly $25 billion to shareholders — including about $3.8 billion via dividends and equivalents as well as another $15.5 billion via open market repurchases of 85 million shares. Apple exited its final quarter of fiscal 2023 with over $162 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet. After subtracting $111 billion of debt, we're left with a net cash position of about $51 billion at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, Apple has a policy of being so-called net cash neutral over time, meaning that if the cash isn't used for acquisitions or organic growth investments, it's returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Quarterly commentary Despite a slightly lower-than-expected Services gross margin of 70.9%, gross income of $15.83 billion for the Services unit managed to outpace expectations thanks to record sales performance. Services, a high-margin business for Apple, reached a new all-time revenue record with growth accelerating to 16% on a year-over-year basis. Notably over the past 12 months, Apple's Services business has generated over $85 billion — equal to a Fortune 50 company. On the call, CEO Tim Cook said Apple \"achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, Payment Services and video as well as a September quarter revenue record in Apple Music.\" Maestri said Apple achieved \"all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category.\" He added that Apple continues to see \"increased customer engagement with our Services, both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double-digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high.\" Products sales came up marginally short versus expectations, the Products segment's gross income of $25.23 billion outpaced estimates thanks to strong gross margin performance of 37.2%, as seen in the earnings table above. On the post-earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said, Apple's \"installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments thanks to high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem.\" iPhone sales for the quarter of $43.81 billion were up from a year ago, slightly outpaced expectations, and represent a new September-quarter record. Maestri said that \"iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switches.\" Given all the China demand concerns, we're pleased to hear on the call that iPhone sales set \"quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and an all-time record in India.\" Mac sales declined in the quarter to $7.61 billion, missing expectations. The decline was due in part to challenging market conditions and a difficult comp versus the year-ago period. That said, keep in mind that the company just unveiled new M3 chip Macs earlier this week, so we should see a rebound here in the current quarter, Maestri said, \"Our install base is at an all-time high and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air.\" iPad revenue was down 10% to $6.44 billion but outpaced expectations. Over half of iPad buyers in the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, Home, and Accessories sales of $9.32 billion were down slightly versus the year-ago period and below estimates. On the call, Maestri said, \"Apple Watch continues to expand its reach with nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.\" Guidance For the current December quarter, Apple expects revenue to be in line with the year-ago period's $117.15 billion — so flat and a bit light. However, there's one less week in this year's December quarter. That extra week last year added about 7 percentage points to the company's total quarterly revenue. Foreign exchange will still be a headwind but improving sequentially, with the team estimating a negative year-over-year impact of about 1 percentage point. iPhone sales are expected to grow versus the year-ago period on an absolute basis and after normalizing for last year's supply disruptions and the extra week. Mac year-over-year performance was guided to \"significantly accelerate from the September quarter.\" The company also said, \"Year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables Home and Accessories [will] decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.\" Management expects \"average revenue per week [in Services] to grow at a similar, strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter.\" Gross margin for the December quarter is expected to be between 45% and 46%, which even on the low end is a full percentage point better than the 44% estimate coming into the print.

        "content": "The major averages advanced again this week as earnings results came in largely better than expected, interest rates stabilized and oil prices dropped below $80 a barrel. The S & P 500 finished up 1.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.65%. Stocks nearly finished lower. Higher bonds yields on Thursday led to a major sell-off that ended the longest winning streaks for the S & P and Nasdaq in two years. A late rally on Friday put equities back in the black for the week. The lion's share of the S & P 500 — 92% — has now reported earnings, with 81% of those delivering an upside earnings surprise and 61% reporting a beat on revenues, according to FactSet. In the portfolio, Coterra Energy (CTRA) put up solid results with strong cash flow generation on the back of better-than-expected production. Emerson Electric (EMR), on the other hand, failed to demonstrate consistent execution and we were forced to downgrade shares to a 3 rating. We liked what we heard from Disney (DIS) as management increased its cost-cutting targets and guided to about $8 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2024. If achieved, that would be the greatest free cash flow year since fiscal 2018. Finally, the market overreacted to Wynn Resort's (WYNN) miss in Macau and we stepped in to pick up some shares on Friday. Looking ahead, we'll get a couple more earnings results and some key inflationary data to chew on. The macroeconomic report of the week comes on Tuesday: the consumer price index (CPI). Per usual this year, we're looking for disinflation. And while the headline number is important, it's the core number that the market is likely to focus on as it strips out food and energy prices, both of which are inherently volatile. As of Friday, the consensus expectation is for a 3.3% annual increase, down from the 3.7% rate of increase in September. At the core level, we're looking for a 4.1% rate of advance, in line with last month. Those are the expectations. Anything weaker — but not so low that it sparks fears of a hard landing — will be cheered by the market. Expect the Street to scrutinize the details. One line item we're watching closely is the shelter index, as this has proven a stickier area of inflation than other sectors of the economy. It also punches above its weight in terms of economic impact given the associated goods and services that come with building new housing. The producer price index (PPI) arrives on Wednesday. The CPI is the more important of the two, but the PPI is important because it can point to what we may see on future CPI readings. High input costs can ultimately translate into higher selling prices as business look to protect profits. October retail sales are also released on Wednesday. With many wondering how much buying power the consumer has left and expectations for holiday spending growth to be muted, the current expectation is for a small pullback from September. That's not too surprising given many are feeling the pain from higher prices. We also wouldn't be surprised if folks held off on shopping in October in anticipation of holiday discounts. Lastly, housing starts hit Friday morning. Shelter cost inflation has been stubborn, partly due to a lack of supply, which supports higher list prices that are then compounded by high mortgage rates. As a result, the more home starts the better. Currently, the consensus estimate stands at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.334 million, which would be a slight decrease from September. Earnings . TJX Companies (TJX) delivers its third-quarter numbers on Wednesday before the bell. The last time we heard from TJX, management said the third quarter —the one being reported next week — was off to a 'very strong start.' So the question is: Did that strength sustain through the quarter and if so, did it carry into the current one, too. Looking ahead, we're especially interested in hearing how the off-price buying environment and consumer spending power looks going into the holiday shopping season. We know the consumer is becoming increasingly budget conscious and value-oriented and that is a high-level concern. However, while aggregate spending is not expected to see much growth, TJX is in a position to win as it offers high-quality goods at discounts and a treasure-hunting experience shoppers love. For Palo Alto Networks (PANW), the question is the same as it's been all year: Is it experiencing the slowdown some its security provider rivals are reporting? Or is it the cause, by grabbing share? This is the third time this year in which PANW took a hit ahead of the release due to negative comments from peers. The last two times the fears were unwarranted because Palo Alto was indeed the cause of their struggles. We fell pretty good about the name and the mission-critical nature of its offerings. Cyber security is a must-have for companies since proprietary data is the ultimate currency. Here's the full rundown of all the important domestic data in the week ahead.

        "description": "It's been a long time since I can come to you and say that the sellers that have plagued us since the end of 2021 might finally be moving on, Cramer writes.",
        "content": "It's been a very long time since I can come to you and say that the sellers that have plagued us since the end of 2021 might finally be moving on. I have become quite torn about all the work we do on individual companies because we know from Tuesday's cooler consumer price index report that bond yields are the ultimate determinant of the stock market's direction. Treasury yields pulled back on the latest data showing inflation is slowing, sending equities soaring . I wish that weren't the case. It means that you can find some excellent companies, buy them, and have them deliver terrific earnings — and it doesn't mean a thing if rates start climbing. Similarly, you can get bailed out of a lot of junk when rates start going down, as we have seen for the last few weeks. So, what's the point? Why bother? I think that you have to put yourself in the shoes of the people who, right now, are trying to decide if they want to own the stock of Apple (AAPL) or they want to buy Nvidia (NVDA). It's easy to say why mess with individual stocks, it isn't worth it. But I would argue that our homework allowed us to stay in stocks when so many others left the market altogether. We certainly didn't want to trade Apple and Nvidia – the Club's two 'own it, don't trade it' stocks – as so many did. We wanted to own them. Think back for a moment about how much it hurt to own Apple at $169 a share. It was a nightmare, wasn't it? You had all of these people with all of these models and sources, and they were telling you it was a no growth company suffering from an inability to grow. Our work said otherwise. Most sellers hadn't done enough homework to be able to stay in when those motivated by higher bond yields sold the whole market down, with Apple included. Nvidia's even harder to own. When the stock was ticking down to $400 a share not that long ago, I started wondering what Nvidia's next act would be. The U.S. government was cracking down on AI chip exports to China. Who would they sell all of their graphics processing units (GPUs) to? Some were saying that Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) were catching up. But my homework said that there was so much demand for Nvidia's advanced chips that it wouldn't have a hard time placing them. So many companies have still not moved to the cloud that the idea that Nvidia's cards wouldn't have staying power seemed fanciful. No, what got to me was a chartist saying that Nvidia's stock had the worst technical shape of any stock in the entire market. Sure enough, there was a head-and-shoulders pattern that was hideous. I couldn't believe I hadn't spotted it before. But I had said 'own it don't trade it' because I believe that artificial intelligence needs Nvidia's chips more than anything else, more than any other part of the food chain. Therefore, I knew that the chart would be wrong. And it was. We are in Nvidia. Those who just acted based on that chart are not. We caught ten days in a row of Nvidia gains. What have they caught? Right now, though, I want to make things clear: you can't leave this market. There is way too much money on the sidelines. There is way too much hatred for this market still. There are people who believe that stocks outside of the Magnificent Seven aren't ever going to make you money. Most strategists are on the wrong side of the trade. I don't really care which stocks we make money in. We just want to buy the stocks that fit the description of companies that can do well even if the Federal Reserve doesn't cut interest rates anytime soon – because I don't think they will. I don't think it is time to go for higher yielding stocks. If anything, I just want to buy stocks of companies that have a tailwind from U.S. infrastructure spending that the Fed can't hurt and Congress can't go back on. More broadly, I have been trying to figure out how to express my frustration with some of my mistakes. And then it hit me. The late great country singer Kenny Rodgers once crooned the song, \"The Gambler,\" in which he told us that you \"need to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away and when to run.\" I wish I had thought more about those options this year. It would have caused a lot less heartache. As we wind down to the final weeks of the year, I've been looking back and thinking about which stocks fit Kenny's categories. When it comes to knowing when to hold them, what that means is recognizing a company that is doing well when its stock isn't. We knew, for example, that Starbucks (SBUX) was doing better than its $90 perch. We knew because we had tremendous confidence in its business in China, and we knew its U.S. business wouldn't skip a beat. We felt the same way about the stocks of Procter & Gamble (PG) and GE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC) when they took big swoons. We knew they had lasting value. We were willing to do battle to keep them – battle meaning picking up some shares lower, perhaps, to sell some higher in order to get a better cost basis. Conversely, the moment that Emerson Electric (EMR) announced that it was going hostile in its bid for National Instruments earlier this year, I criticized management hard. We had bought the company because we thought it was going to help fix our electric grid and make it so we had cleaner energy. We thought Emerson would be the industrial digitizer, the company that would automate American industry. Instead, it got all bogged down in trying to buy some instruments company. So why didn't I fold them right then? It's a great question, and the answer is that I often take my cue from a stock's action and the action was so powerfully positive that I didn't believe my own judgment that things had gone awry. I let the crowd determine my own thinking. Now that the stock has bounced back a bit after reporting a miserable quarter , we are going to say goodbye. We have sold some stock for two days now, whittling the position lower because the company is just not as well run as we thought. And I think we should sell more because the market is overbought. Now, what about Danaher (DHR) using the Kenny Rodgers analogy? Hindsight says I should have known to walk away, but I have been in and around this stock almost my entire life. It is a stock that I recommended at Goldman Sachs in the 1980s and did well with. And now it is on the worst losing streak in the company's history. But we're still holding it because its biomedical business is finally bottoming, and the company has the fire power and the smarts to acquire more high-growth opportunities. It is just a matter of when, not if. And I feel that if we sell it, the next day will be the when. That's all to say that Tuesday's explosive rally is going to bring out biotech initial public offerings, and that money will go to Danaher and that stock will work for us. So, that brings me to the walk away and run. How many red flags could I have missed with Walt Disney (DIS)? The answer is that I believed in the franchise value of the company, a franchise value that some good manager had to be able to bring out. I kept thinking that it couldn't be so hard to turn around the best intellectual-property company in the world. But it's turned out to be really hard. The stock is finally starting to come back , and I am grateful for that. But my almost-blind allegiance to the franchise led me astray and I have had to do a lot of soul searching about why we didn't cut and run when we saw there was no Netflix with a theme park here. Finally, when should I have just flat out run? Bausch Health (BHC). You know why I didn't? Because it fell so fast to a level that I thought it wasn't worth selling. And then it fell hard again, making a mockery of that earlier judgment. I would walk away from Emerson. And I should have run from Bausch.

        "content": "You think and think and think, and you still can't believe that things changed so radically in such a short period of time. You can't believe that people were actually willing to pay 26 times earnings for a cellphone company like Apple (AAPL). You find it hard to believe that Amazon (AMZN), under attack from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, just keeps powering higher, despite the ‘weakening consumer.' Meta Platforms (META) manages to lose even more money on some quixotic effort that seems to make no sense and all of a sudden we look away? Alphabet (GOOGL) disappoints in the cloud, and doesn't even break out how its most important YouTube initiative in years — the NFL Sunday ticket — is doing, and nobody cares? What the heck is going on? I have spent a lot of time thinking about this counter-intuitive rise in the stock market over the last two weeks. And I realized that you basically have to throw out any factors about individual stocks that might have been holding them back. So, let's pull apart Apple, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet to try to understand how unimportant what actually happened at these companies might be. AAPL 1M mountain Apple (AAPL) one-month performance. When you go over the timeline of Apple you will notice a particular piece of research — a KeyBanc report from early October that downgraded Apple stock to a hold-equivalent rating from buy on concerns over iPhone sales. The piece stands out because the analyst looked at everything everyone else did — including the lack of growth, the plateauing of wearables, the decline in Macs and iPads, and the lack of a new killer phone — and decided that it's time just to admit the emperor of this market has been naked long enough. As shocking as it was to see a downgrade, it crystalized what everyone was thinking. Sure, I know I rushed to differ. I didn't focus on the hardware. I was looking at the services revenue and figured it would soon be equal to all of the disparate adjacencies to cellphones — the Mac, the iPad, the wearables. I measured the lifetime value of a new Apple ‘subscriber' from the Philippines or Indonesia or Brazil or Vietnam and decided that the amalgamated sub growth from all of these new countries hitting all-time sales highs could offset the weakness in China. And why not? The stock had run into the print, erasing the decline the KeyBanc downgrade had caused. When the numbers came out, they were pretty much exactly as KeyBanc expected. So, logically, the stock should have headed right back down. That is, if logic were involved. Instead, Apple stock has climbed roughly 5% since it reported quarterly results on Nov. 2. AMZN 1M mountain Amazon (AMZN) one-month performance. Now consider the case of Amazon. The media adores FTC Chair Lina Khan's suit targeting Amazon because our country doesn't like big, powerful companies. It doesn't matter if Amazon is fabulous for the consumer and Prime's an amazing deal, what matters is there must be someone aggrieved by this, so let's go after Amazon to protect sellers who might have been able to sell products for more money if Amazon didn't exist. It doesn't matter that they might sell 10 times more with Amazon. Somehow it's the profit per item that seems to matter to Khan, even if the ultimate amount the seller makes from Amazon far exceeds what it might make otherwise. It's a uniquely incorrect way to look at things when it comes to economics, but when it comes to populism I give her an A + on her paper. But toss the media's love affair aside. The fact is that when Amazon reported there was nothing that stood out when it came to retail. Nothing. Nor when it came to advertising. The only thing that mattered was that cloud unit Amazon Web Services put up a number that showed a stabilization in growth, albeit at a relatively low level. But after initially getting hit, the stock did manage to stage a rally — climbing roughly 20% since reporting earnings in late October. META 1M mountain Meta Platforms (META) one-month performance. Meanwhile, Meta's quarter was curious , to say the least. You got good Instagram results, but horrendous losses in the so-called metaverse. For no fathomable reason. And then out of nowhere the company announced that there had been a pause in consumer packaged goods sales because of the Israel-Gaza war. Of course the sellers went nuts with that. Meta stock fell to $288 a share, down from $314, in a couple of sessions just because of that line in its earnings report. But like Apple and Amazon, Meta stock stabilized and has risen more than 14% since late October. GOOGL 1M mountain Alphabet (GOOGL) one-month performance. Alphabet put up extraordinarily good numbers this earnings season, except from the division that was supposed to be the new leader and the next leg up: Google Cloud. Depending upon which bull you read, Google Cloud was supposed to make somewhere between $8.5 billion and $8.75 billion and, instead it came in at $8.41 billion, the slowest growth since the first quarter of 2021. Didn't matter — at least to the sellers — that the unit made $266 million after losing $440 million last year. All other metrics that Alphabet delivered were overshadowed by that one small piece of the Alphabet puzzle. Had they explained that YouTube was turbo-charged by the NFL Sunday ticket it might have overshadowed the disappointing cloud number. Even so, Alphabet stock also staged a recovery, gaining more than 8% since late October. Now, let's consider the obvious. There was nothing in any of these reports, nothing, that was a clear upside surprise. Not one of these companies gave you a forecast boost. Sure, you saw a pause in the growth decline at Amazon Web Services. But Apple was slightly worse around the margins. The sudden advertising slowdown at Meta certainly gave you a scare. Managements at Apple and Alphabet seem content to give you nothing to make you feel the next quarter, or two or even three, would be better. They might be worse! And yet what has happened since those reports? Where have those stocks traveled to? These moves, these monumental moves, are only about one thing: the potential peak in the bond market's hideous slide in price and increase in yield. All that research, all of those line items and predictions and judgments versus models meant almost nothing. None of these companies had a true step function higher, an actual beat and magnificent raise like you got from Microsoft (MSFT). Yet they all went up fairly similarly because of Treasury yields. I know I got lucky in my thinking. My mantra is to own Apple not to trade it, which is as much a denigration of those who opine and endlessly trade on it as it is something that measures the greatness of this consumer-tech company. Whatever. I offer thanks to the bond market for making me look smarter than I am. The fact is a stabilization in rates caused these moves. We don't know if yields stabilized because the inflation inputs are now going in the right direction. We don't know if the Federal Reserve may be finished with interest-rate hikes. Let's just say the economic data coalesced with a Fed that didn't raise rates this month and a Treasury that put out a smart bond0-issuance schedule, to put in a short-term peak in yields. That's what happened. Nothing more, nothing less. These last two weeks have been a bit of a comeuppance to all of us who still think that how companies do really matters to their valuations. But I don't want to stop doing homework because of what happened. Nor do I think that the homework revealed a reason to bail. These companies are making huge amounts of money. They are the best we have. I believe you have to overlook the bond market and stay in them. You didn't just get lucky. Which brings me full circle. Sometimes what matters more than being in the right stocks is to not be shaken out of stocks entirely. If you go back to that KeyBanc buy-to-hold of Apple, all that analyst did was acknowledge the current wisdom that Apple's not a growth company anymore. If you found another way to value Apple, as I have, measuring it as a tech consumer company that competes with Procter & Gamble (PG) for price-to-earnings prominence, then you managed to stay in the stock and benefit from the change in the bond market's fortunes. Oh, the cynic might say: but what if rates had kept climbing? My answer: they didn't. The cynics lost, the optimists won. It was, like they say in the NFL, an ugly W, but it was a W nonetheless. And that's all that matters. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL, AMZN, META, GOOGL, MSFT, PG. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

        "content": "The major averages rebounded strongly this week as quarterly earnings came in largely better than expected and interest rates fell on softer economic data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 5% for its best week since October 2022. The S & P 500 increased more than 6% with its first five-day winning streak since June, while the Nasdaq gained more than 6%. The October jobs report on Friday came in weaker than expected, which is exactly what Wall Street hoped for as it shows the Fed's plan to beat down inflation is working. The U.S. economy last month added 150,000 jobs, below the 170,000 payrolls increase expected, and lower than September's 297,000 jobs added. Average hourly earnings also came in softer, rising 0.2% compared to the expected 0.3% increase. In addition to the favorable jobs data (at least from Wall Street's perspective), both the ISM Manufacturing report on Wednesday and ISM Services report on Friday came in slightly below expectations. This kind of slowdown isn't something to cheer about, but is a positive for the stock market since it keeps the Fed and interest-rate hawks in pause mode. Earnings season has so far beat expectations. According to FactSet, of the 81% of S & P 500 companies that have reported third-quarter earnings results so far, 82% reported an upside earnings surprise, while 62% reported better-than-expected revenue results. We hope to see that trend continue in the days ahead. Looking ahead, there are only a few macroeconomic updates on deck, including Tuesday's consumer credit data for September, Thursday's weekly jobless claims, and Friday's look at the Treasury's October budget statement. The big theme next week is earnings and the four portfolio companies delivering their quarterly results. Coterra Energy (CTRA) delivers its third-quarter numbers after the closing bell Monday, with the conference call on Tuesday morning. The things to watch in the release and on the post-earnings call from this 50/50 oil and natural gas exploration and production company are free cash flow, dividends and buybacks, as well as guidance on capital expenditures and production. Output with disciplined capital expenditures is always key. We want to avoid a repeat of Coterra's mixed Q2 . Additionally, we're curious to hear management's thoughts on the turmoil in the Middle East — specifically, how they're thinking about global commodity prices from the perspective of a U.S. producer. Industrial automation company Emerson Electric (EMR) reports third-quarter earnings before the opening bell Tuesday. It was a beat and raise last time around, with management calling out resilient end-market demand and an improving supply chain dynamic. We hope to see more of the same. The introduction of 2024 guidance will also be key with Wall Street expecting accretion from recently acquired National Instruments, perhaps as much as 50 cents per share. Orders are expected to be up sequentially. Disney (DIS) is out with results from its final quarter of 2023 after the bell Wednesday. The company will be reporting for the first time under its new three-segment structure , which breaks sports out of entertainment and leaves the experiences unit pretty much the same. In addition to general comments on the progress of management's ongoing turnaround efforts, commentary around theme park demand will be key as the business has been supporting the bottom line. Additionally, we'll be watching for any color management can provide on their plans to integrate Hulu — now that Disney announced a deal to purchase the 33% it didn't own from CNBC-parent Comcast (CMCSA). With a deal in the works on Hulu, it will be also interesting to see if there any updated thoughts on the path ahead for ESPN — now that sports will be reported as its own unit. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) issues its third-quarter earnings after the bell Thursday. Results and commentary on Macao will likely carry the most weight. That's the gambling hub of Asia that's located in a special administrative region of China. Las Vegas Sands (LVS), which despite its name only operates casinos in Singapore and Macao, already reported a better-than-expected quarter and stronger Macao numbers. That bodes well for Wynn, which also has operations the U.S. Wynn's Vegas and Boston locations did well last quarter. Wynn Interactive in Q2 burned less money sequentially and year over year. Any update on Wynn's construction of a property in the United Arab Emirates would also be of note. Here's the full rundown of all the important domestic data in the week ahead as we consider a number areas of our portfolio for trades next week.

Here's how you can create a PayPal account: Visit the PayPal website: Open your preferred web browser and go to the PayPal website. The website URL is www.paypal.com. Click on 'Sign Up': On the PayPal homepage, you will see a 'Sign Up' button. Click on it to begin the account creation process. Select your account type: PayPal offers different account types, including Personal, Business, and Premier. Choose the one that suits your needs and click on it.

Make sure to use a valid email address as it will be used to log in to your PayPal account.

If you prefer not to link any payment methods at this stage, you can do it later. Verify your email address: After completing the sign-up form, PayPal will send a verification email to the address you provided. Open the email and click on the verification link to activate your account. Set up additional security measures (optional): To enhance the security of your account, PayPal offers options such as two-factor authentication and security questions. You can choose to set up these additional security measures to protect your account from unauthorized access. Agree to the terms and conditions: Carefully read through PayPal's terms and conditions and privacy policy. If you agree to them, check the box provided, and click on 'Agree and Create Account.' Once you have completed these steps, your PayPal account will be created, and you can proceed to the next step of linking your PayPal account to DHgate. Step 2: Linking Your PayPal Account to DHgate Now that you have a PayPal account, the next step is to link it to your DHgate account. This will allow you to use PayPal as a payment method when making purchases on DHgate.

You will be prompted to enter the amount you wish to add and select the source from which the funds will be deducted. Confirm and complete the transaction: Review the details of the transaction and click on the 'Add' or similar button to initiate the transfer of funds. Follow any additional prompts to complete the process. Verify the addition of funds: Once the transaction is complete, you should see the added funds reflected in your PayPal account balance. You can verify this by checking the 'Wallet' section or the account summary on your PayPal dashboard. It's important to note that adding funds to your PayPal account may take some time, depending on the payment method you used.

        "description": "Get the breakdown on Fanatics Casino as the platform prepares to go live by the end of 2023! Read on for more information about the Fanatics Casino mobile app, how to sign up, and details on the upcoming Fanatics Casino promo code!",
        "content": "Commercial Content. 21+. Action Network is the official betting partner of the New York Post, which edits this content.\nWhile Fanatics Casino is not yet operational, significant anticipation surrounds its forthcoming launch. Fanatics plans to go live with its online casino website and mobile app by the close of 2023, with expected availability in multiple states.\nFanatics Sportsbook recently made a notable entry in a crowded U.S. sportsbook market, generating considerable attention. This successful debut in the sports betting industry leads us to anticipate a similar impact when its online casino platform goes live.\nWhat is the Fanatics Casino Promo Code?\nAnticipating the launch of Fanatics Casino, it's probable that no specific Fanatics Casino promo code will be necessary to access the site's welcome offer. This assumption is based on the existing model of PointsBet Casino, which will soon be transformed into Fanatics Casino after the company's U.S operations were purchased by Fanatics. Though the current new player bonus at PointsBet Casino might leave room for improvement, there's an expectation that Fanatics will enhance the offering as it takes the reins of the casino operations.\nPromotions and bonuses play a crucial role in maintaining competitiveness in the online casino industry, and Fanatics, known for its innovative approach to business, is expected to introduce a range of attractive incentives to cater to both new and existing customers.\nWhile the existing signup promotion at PointsBet Casino consisting of 400 free spins may not meet the expectations of Fanatics' deep pockets and commitment to fierce competition, it's hoped they will opt for a more appealing first deposit match bonus or a substantial stress-free play session for newcomers.\nIt's advisable to stay tuned for updates on Fanatics Online Casino's launch date and take advantage of potential exclusive promo codes for enhanced new player offers, although these promotions will be subject to specific terms and conditions, including deposit requirements, wagering terms, and expiration dates.\nFanatics Casino is also likely to implement a loyalty program, akin to its sportsbook loyalty program, rewarding players with points redeemable for bonus credits and merchandise.\nThese initiatives are expected to enhance the overall betting experience and provide added value to players, although it's important to keep in mind that promotions and bonuses may change periodically.\nWhen will Fanatics Casino Launch?\nFanatics has made a significant foray into the online gambling sector, swiftly rolling out its sportsbook across multiple states and gaining acclaim for its high-quality offerings. The anticipation is that its online casino endeavors will uphold the same level of excellence.\nAri Borod, Chief Business Officer for Fanatics Betting and Gaming, has confirmed the company's plans to introduce an online casino product by the close of 2023, with a 'clear commitment to striving for superiority rather than being the initial entrant in this competitive space.'\nHow to Sign Up with Fanatics Casino\nSigning up for the Fanatics Casino mobile app is a straightforward process that allows you to enjoy a variety of casino games and entertainment from your mobile device. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create an account and get started:\nDownload the App: Start by downloading the Fanatics Casino mobile app from the official app store for your device (e.g., the Apple App Store for iOS or Google Play Store for Android).\nOpen the App: Once the app is installed, open it on your mobile device.\nRegistration: To sign up, you'll typically need to tap on a 'Sign Up' or 'Register' button. You'll be asked to provide your personal information, including your name, date of birth, email address, and sometimes a mobile phone number.\nCreate a Username and Password: Choose a unique username and a strong password for your account. This will be your login information for future access.\nVerification: Fanatics Casino may require you to verify your email address or phone number by sending a verification code. Follow the instructions provided to complete this step.\nAccept Terms and Conditions: Read and accept the casino's terms and conditions and privacy policy. This step is crucial for understanding the rules and regulations of the platform.\nMake Your First Deposit: After successfully creating your account, you can make your first deposit using one of the available payment methods. Fanatics Casino typically offers various options such as credit cards, e-wallets, and more.\nClaim Welcome Bonuses (if available): If Fanatics Casino offers a welcome bonus for new players, be sure to check for any bonus codes or offers during the sign-up process and claim them if desired.\nStart Playing: With your account funded, you're ready to explore the casino's games, place bets, and enjoy the entertainment available on the mobile app.\nWhat States Will Have Access to Fanatics Casino?\nThe direction of Fanatics Casino's expansion plans remains uncertain. Nevertheless, a closer look at PointsBet Casino may provide some indications that Fanatics Casino could potentially target the booming markets in Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.\nIt's important to note that there are only six legal online casino gambling states. Nevada, for example, permits online poker but not online casino games.\nWhile numerous state legislatures have engaged in discussions about the possibility of legalizing online casino gaming, the prevailing trend seems to favor legal sports betting over online casino gaming, despite the significant tax revenue potential it offers.\nStates currently offering online casino gaming options include:\nConnecticut\nDelaware\nMichigan (offering both casino and poker)\nNew Jersey (offering both casino and poker)\nPennsylvania (offering both casino and poker)\nWest Virginia\nStay tuned for further updates!\nExpected Promotions at Fanatics Casino\nFanatics Casino, like many of its competitors in the online gaming industry, is expected to offer a wide range of enticing promotions and bonuses designed to attract and retain new users.\nThese promotions not only serve as incentives to join the platform but also encourage players to stay engaged and enjoy the diverse array of casino games and experiences available.\nFrom welcome bonuses to ongoing promotions, Fanatics Casino is likely to provide various offers that cater to different player preferences, ensuring an exciting and rewarding gaming experience for all.\nHere are some common types of promotions that players can expect at Fanatics Casino:\nWelcome Bonuses: New users often receive a generous welcome bonus upon signing up and making their first deposit. These bonuses can include bonus funds, free spins, or a combination of both.\nDeposit Bonuses: Regular deposit bonuses can be available for existing users, where a percentage of their deposit amount is matched as a bonus. These promotions can be daily, weekly, or monthly.\nFree Spins: Fanatics Casino is likely to offer free spins promotions on select slot games, allowing players to spin the reels without using their own funds.\nCashback Offers: Players might have the opportunity to receive a percentage of their losses back as cashback, providing a safety net for their gameplay.\nLoyalty Programs: A loyalty or VIP program is expected, where players earn points or climb tiers as they play, unlocking exclusive rewards, higher bonuses, and personalized customer support.\nTournaments and Competitions: Fanatics Casino may host regular tournaments and competitions with cash prizes or other valuable rewards for the top-performing players.\nSeasonal Promotions: Special promotions tied to holidays or seasons are common, offering unique bonuses and themed events.\nRefer-a-Friend Bonuses: Players who refer friends to the casino may receive bonuses or rewards for successful referrals.\nAvailable Online Casino Games at Fanatics Casino\nFanatics Casino is expected to offer a diverse array of online casino games, catering to a wide range of player preferences and providing an immersive gaming experience.\nPlayers can anticipate finding a variety of common casino game types, ensuring there's something for everyone.\nSlots\nSlots, also known as slot machines or pokies in some regions, are one of the most popular and iconic casino games. They are incredibly straightforward to play and offer a thrilling and fast-paced gaming experience.\nIn a typical slot game, players spin the reels, which are adorned with various symbols, and aim to align specific combinations to win prizes.\nThese combinations often include matching symbols on predetermined paylines. The outcomes of slot games are determined by a random number generator (RNG), ensuring fairness and unpredictability.\nSlots come in a variety of themes, styles, and features, making them appealing to a broad audience. Some slots have classic designs with fruit symbols, bells, and lucky sevens, while others incorporate complex storylines, interactive bonus rounds, and stunning visual and audio effects.\nAdditionally, many slots offer the chance to win progressive jackpots, where a portion of each bet contributes to a continuously growing prize pool, sometimes reaching life-changing sums.\nSlots are known for accessibility, making them a favorite choice for both novice and experienced casino players.\nBlackjack\nBlackjack is a classic and widely popular casino card game that combines skill and strategy. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.\nEach card in the deck has a point value: numbered cards are worth the face value, face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are worth 10 points each, and aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on what benefits the player's hand.\nPlayers are dealt two initial cards and can choose to 'hit' (receive additional cards) to improve their hand or 'stand' (keep their current hand). The player's goal is to achieve a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without going over.\nIf a player's hand exceeds 21, they 'bust' and lose their bet. Blackjack is particularly known for its strategic depth, with players making decisions based on the visible dealer's card and their hand.\nIt's a game of probabilities, and skilled players can employ various strategies, such as card counting, to increase their chances of winning.\nLive Dealer Games\nLive dealer games provide an immersive and authentic casino experience in the online gambling world. Unlike traditional online casino games, live dealer games are hosted by real, professionally trained dealers who interact with players through live video streams.\nThese games often include popular casino classics such as blackjack, roulette, baccarat, and poker.\nPlayers can participate in live dealer games from their homes, observing and interacting with the dealer and other players via a chat interface.\nThis creates a more social and realistic casino atmosphere, making it a compelling option for those seeking the thrill of a land-based casino without the need to travel.\nLive dealer games combine the convenience of online gaming with the interpersonal aspects of traditional casinos, offering an engaging and entertaining gambling experience.\nRoulette\nRoulette is a classic and iconic casino game known for its simplicity and excitement. The game consists of a spinning wheel with numbered pockets and a small ball.\nPlayers place bets on the outcome of the ball's landing position, which can be on a specific number, color (red or black), or various groupings of numbers.\nThe wheel is divided into two main types of pockets: the numbers 1 to 36 are alternately colored red and black, while there are one or two green pockets marked with 0 (and sometimes 00 in American roulette).\nOnce bets are placed, the croupier (casino dealer) spins the wheel in one direction and releases the ball in the opposite direction. Players watch with anticipation as the ball eventually settles into one of the pockets.\nWinning bets are paid out based on the type of bet and the specific outcome while losing bets are collected by the casino. Roulette offers a mix of luck and strategy, making it a favorite choice for casino enthusiasts looking for a thrilling and unpredictable gaming experience.\nPoker\nPoker is a renowned and highly strategic card game that has various forms and is popular in both casino and home settings. The most common version found in casinos is Texas Hold'em.\nIn poker, players compete to win chips or money by forming the best possible hand, or by using skill and strategic bluffing to convince opponents to fold their hands.\nEach player is dealt a set of cards, and a series of rounds of betting ensues. The game's complexity arises from the various combinations of hands, such as pairs, straights, and flushes, each with its own ranking and value.\nPoker involves not only understanding the game's rules but also reading opponents, managing risk, and making calculated decisions based on the information available.\nWhile luck plays a role in the short term, poker is primarily a game of skill and psychology, making it a fascinating and intellectually challenging casino game for those who enjoy both the mathematics and the human interaction involved.\nOther casino games\nBaccarat: A card game where players can bet on the 'Player,' 'Banker,' or a 'Tie.' The objective is to have a hand with a total value closest to 9.\nCraps: A dice game where players wager on the outcome of the roll or a series of rolls of two six-sided dice.\nKeno: A lottery-style game where players select numbers and hope they match the drawn numbers for a prize.\nSic Bo: A dice game of Asian origin where players bet on the possible outcomes of the roll of three dice.\nPai Gow Poker: A variation of poker played with a 52-card deck plus a joker, where players aim to create two poker hands, one high and one low, to beat the dealer.\nVideo Poker: Electronic poker games that combine elements of slots and traditional poker, to achieve specific poker hand rankings.\nRoulette Variants: In addition to European and American roulette, you might find other regional variants like French roulette or Mini roulette.\nArcade and Specialty Games: These include games like scratch cards, Wheel of Fortune, and virtual sports betting.\nBingo: A game where players mark off numbers on a card as they are called out, aiming to achieve specific patterns for a win.\nPachinko: A Japanese arcade game that combines elements of pinball and slot machines, often found in Asian-themed casinos.\nLotto and Lottery Games: Some casinos offer lotto-style games where players select numbers and hope for a match.\nVirtual Reality (VR) Games: Emerging technology allows for immersive VR casino games, enhancing the gaming experience.\nFanatics iGaming Timeline\nOctober 2023: FBG secures its New York sports betting license through PointsBet, as officially confirmed by the New York State Gaming Commission on Oct. 4, 2023.\nSeptember 2023: The Fanatics Sportsbook app introduces the live NFL streaming feature, accessible to users who place qualifying wagers on NFL games.

        "description": "Their 15-year marriage began with a fairy tale wedding and saw the birth of two princes, but ended in a public and acrimonious divorce involving infidelity that threatened to rock the monarchy. But…",
        "content": "Died: 31 August 1997, in a car accident in Paris (aged 36)\nMarried to: Prince Charles (m. 1981–96)\nHeight: 1.78 m\nChildren: Prince William (born 1982) and Prince Harry (born 1984)\nGrandchildren: Prince George (born 2013); Princess Charlotte (born 2015); Prince Louis (born 2018); Archie Mountbatten-Windsor (born 2019)\nParents: John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer & Frances Roche\nSiblings: Lady Sarah McCorquodale (1955–present); Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes (1957–present); John Spencer, died within 10 hours of his birth on 12 January 1960; Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer (1964–present)\nEducated: Silfield Private School in Gayton, Norfolk; Riddlesworth Hall School near Thetford; West Heath Girls' School in Sevenoaks, Kent; Institut Alpin Videmanette in Rougemont, Switzerland\nIt was in the summer of 1980, at a house party hosted by Diana's friend Philip de Pass in New Grove, near Petworth, that Prince Charles first saw Diana Spencer as a potential girlfriend. Sitting next to each other on a bale of hay at a post-polo barbecue, an 19-year-old Diana expressed her sympathy for Charles over the loss of his beloved great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, who had been murdered by the IRA a year earlier. 'My heart bled for you when I watched the funeral; I thought, ‘It's wrong, you're lonely – you should be with somebody to look after you',' said Diana. This, says Penny Junor, was exactly what Charles needed to hear.\n'Mountbatten was a very important figure in Charles's life and he was in a fragile state at that point,' says Junor. 'Diana really touched a nerve in Charles, she said just the right thing to him, at the right moment, and he was moved by her.'\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy. You can unsubscribe at any time.\nThis encounter was not, however, the first time Charles and Diana had met. The pair had been introduced two years earlier, in 1977 – Charles thought her 'jolly' when he visited Althorp, the Spencer estate, when he was dating Diana's older sister, Lady Sarah (a relationship that ended in early 1978). Diana had also attended Charles's 30th birthday party along with her sister at Buckingham Palace in November 1978, and in January 1979 Diana again met Charles when she and Sarah were guests of Queen Elizabeth II at a weekend shooting party at Sandringham.\nAfter that weekend, Charles occasionally invited Diana to the ballet as part of a group or to dinner with friends. The relationship was, at this stage, purely platonic – Diana was fun to have around. It was not until their heart-to-heart about Lord Mountbatten in 1980 that Charles first saw Diana as girlfriend material.\nKeen to spend more time with Diana, Charles promptly invited her to Balmoral to join him and a group of friends staying there for a summer holiday. Diana enchanted and delighted. 'She seemed to be the perfect girl,' says Junor. 'She was funny, she was fun, everybody seemed to love her – she made everyone laugh and she seemed to adore Charles.\nA young Diana pictured in 1980. (Photo by Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images)\n'She was, on paper, absolutely perfect as a bride for him. At the time it was thought Charles's bride must be a virgin, an aristocrat and a member of the Church of England. Now, we should remember that by the 1980s, after the 1960s sexual revolution and the introduction of the contraceptive pill, there were very few aristocratic virgins around, and as time went by – Charles was by this point in his 30s – they were getting fewer and fewer.\n'So, here was this girl who appeared to be absolutely lovely; perfect marriage material. And she appeared to be very uncomplicated. She was fresh and naïve and full of the joys of life. Or so it seemed. '\nBut, says Junor, pressure began to mount on Charles and Diana almost immediately.\n' Ever since Charles was around the age of 18 the press had been looking at every girlfriend and asking, ‘could this be our next queen?'. They delved into the background of all of these women, which put an awful lot of them off. It was very difficult for Charles to meet and get to know somebody. And this is exactly what happened with Diana: she met Charles and almost immediately the press discovered that he was seeing her. The paparazzi camped outside the door to her flat in London; everywhere she went she was photographed and harassed. It was impossible for the two of them to get to know one another in any sort of ‘normal' way.'\nLady Diana Spencer arriving at her flat, November 1980.

It was time for Charles, who was now in his 30s, to settle down and find a wife, his father thought. 'The bottom line being, of course, that every heir requires an heir of his own in order to keep the monarchy going,' says Junor.\nThe catalyst came in the form of a memo sent by Prince Philip to his son in early 1981 urging him to make up his mind. You either marry this girl or you let her go, he wrote.\nBut, says Junor, this memo was fatefully misinterpreted by Charles. 'The royal family communicates with one another in very strange ways,' she said.\n'Rather than just picking up the phone or having a chat face-to-face, it was all done through memos . Charles misread his father's memo: he thought he was being told that he must marry Diana – and so he asked her to marry him.'\nCharles proposed to Diana on 6 February 1981 at Windsor Castle. But it was a tragic mismatch, says Junor. Charles and Diana had, at this point, barely spent any time together – Diana later claimed that she and Charles had met only 13 times before they became engaged. 'And most of that time they'd not spent alone together,' Junor adds. 'So they really didn't know one another at all.'\nLady Diana Spencer with Prince Charles in the gardens of Buckingham Palace on the day they announced their engagement, 24 February 1981. (Photo by Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images)\nDiana soon began to struggle in her new role. Aged just 19 and having been living happily in a flatshare in London with a group of girl friends, Diana was taken away from everything she knew and moved into a suite of rooms at Buckingham Palace.\n'It was awful for her, and lonely,' says Junor. 'As soon as she moved into Buckingham Palace she appeared to be a very different girl from the girl she had been at Balmoral – she suddenly became very weepy and jealous of anywhere Charles went and anyone he saw. Her moods went up and down; shooting to stardom in a very short space of time was too much for her.\n'Meanwhile Charles, who was on a perpetual rollercoaster of engagements that he couldn't get off, didn't quite know how to cope with this; he didn't know what was going on.'\nThe recently engaged Charles and Diana pictured at Craigowan Lodge on the Balmoral estate, May 1981. (Photo by Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images)\nDiana was struggling with her mental health and with the eating disorder bulimia, says Junor. 'She'd had a very traumatic childhood; she was a very damaged little girl who had grown into a very damaged young woman , ' says the royal biographer. Diana's parents had endured an unhappy marriage and separated when she was just six years old.\nA year-and-a-half before Diana was born, her mother, Frances Ruth Roche, who was already the mother of two girls, Diana's elder sisters, had given birth to a baby boy who died when he was just 10 hours old. Diana was born 18 months later, in July 1961, followed by a much-wanted male heir: Diana's younger brother, Charles.\nA young Diana playing with her brother, Charles, in the grounds of Park House, Sandringham, when she was six years old. (Photo by)\nWhen Charles was around the age of two or three, Diana's mother met Peter Shand Kydd, an heir to the wallpaper fortune built by his father, Norman Shand Kydd. The pair began an affair and later decided to become a couple. 'Frances thought she could finally be happy, and she had every intention of taking her children with her,' says Junor.\nBut, tragically, Frances lost custody of Diana and her three siblings following an intervention by her mother, Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy, a lady-in-waiting to the Queen Mother. 'Appalled that her daughter had run off with a ‘man in trade', Baroness Fermoy gave evidence in the custody proceedings against her own daughter,' says Junor.\n'She told the court Frances was a bad mother, and as a result, custody of all four children went to Diana's father. This is, I believe, why Diana's mother later became a reclusive and very sad woman. It was because she had lost her children.'\nA young Diana pictured in 1970 holding a croquet mallet during a game at Itchenor, West Sussex. (Photo by)\nDiana, aged just seven and completely unaware of the custody proceedings, was left feeling abandoned and as though her mother did not love her enough to take her with her. 'And then she worked out that actually she was a bit of a nuisance,' says Junor. 'Her mother and father had wanted a boy, and that boy had died. Diana later told journalist Andrew Morton [who wrote the authorised 1992 biography Diana: Her True Story ], her parents had tried for another boy but ended up with Diana.\n'Diana felt very unloved and unwanted, and she took those feelings into her adult life – she was always desperate to be loved but expected people to abandon her.'\nDiana struggled with bulimia for many years before seeking professional help.\nIt's difficult to know when exactly it started, but it was 'in full swing' by the time of their honeymoon, says Junor. She may initially have been treated for anorexia.\n'I think that the eating disorder was a manifestation of a much greater disorder,' says Junor. 'Her mental health was poor; she had struggled mentally from childhood.\n'Bulimia and anorexia are very destructive conditions; they're very hard to live with,' says Junor.\nRevelations of Diana's bulimia were first published in Andrew Morton's 1992 authorised biography, Diana: Her True Story . She later spoke about her struggle with the condition in her famous 1995 Panorama interview with Martin Bashir. [In 2021, an independent inquiry found that Bashir had used deception to secure the interview]\n'I think she felt that nobody could help her,' says Junor. She saw various conventional therapists but also turned to a number of alternative, complementary therapists including astrologers and crystal healers.'\nThe wedding of Charles and Diana married at St Paul's Cathedral on 29 July 1981 in what has been described as the wedding of the century. 'I think Charles and Diana both knew they were making a mistake when they walked down the aisle,' says Junor.\n'But it would have taken somebody very brave to cancel at that point. Charles had always said that marriage for him must be for life and it was therefore very important that he marry the right girl – ‘If I'm deciding [on] whom I want to live with for 50 years – well, that's the last decision on which I [would] want my head to be ruled by my heart.'\nDiana and Charles leaving St Paul's Cathedral following their wedding ceremony on 29 July 1981. (Photo by)\n'So although I don't think he was actually in love with Diana, I think he thought he could grow to love her. Fundamentally I think he had every intention of making his marriage work.\n'A lot of people believe that Charles used Diana; that he never loved her and he never had any intention of honouring his marriage vows. They think he just needed his heir and his ‘spare' and that once that was achieved, he went off with the woman he'd always loved, Camilla. That is very much the story that a lot of people like to believe.\n'Having spoken to a great many people who were around at the time, I happen to believe that story is completely wrong. I have always felt that it was just a very tragic mismatch; these two people were just completely wrong for one another. I really do not think that Charles used Diana or intended to use Diana, but once he was inside that marriage life was utterly unbearable for both of them.'\nRead more | Prince Charles and Camilla: a history of their romance\nCharles's relationship with Camilla had ended when she married Andrew Parker Bowles in the summer of 1973. Camilla settled into her new life as a wife and mother and her friendship with Charles remained platonic in the years that followed. But the pair restarted their affair shortly after the birth of Camilla's second child, Laura, in early 1978, and in 1979 Charles turned to Camilla for consolation for his grief following the death of Lord Mountbatten. Camilla was 'his best friend, his soul mate, and, and after the death of his great-uncle, lover,' writes Marlene Koenig in this article for HistoryExtra . This second affair lasted until Charles's engagement to Diana in 1981.\n'Camilla's husband, unfortunately, was very unfaithful to her, so she was very lonesome in her marriage,' says Junor. 'And Charles made her feel good. Who can blame her for enjoying that relationship while Charles was single? But she knew that once Charles became married, the physical side of their relationship would end. She was under no illusion that it would carry on. And when Camilla realised that Diana was jealous of her, she stepped right back.'\nTensions were made worse by the fact that Charles had failed to tell Diana about his history with Camilla when they first began dating, says Junor. Early on in his relationship with Diana, they even went to stay with the Parker Bowles's, but Charles did not disclose the fact Camilla was his ex-girlfriend. Instead, Diana found out on the grapevine 'through Buckingham Palace gossip,' says Junor. 'As a 19-year-old, Diana would have been hugely upset by that, and very jealous,' she adds. 'She probably felt like a bit of a fool'.\nLady Diana Spencer and Camilla Parker Bowles at Ludlow Races where Prince Charles was competing, 1980. (Photo by Express Newspapers/Archive Photos)\nThe last time Charles and Camilla saw one another before he married Diana was just a few days before the wedding. They had one final lunch together, during which Charles gifted Camilla a bracelet inscribed with the letters ‘G' and ‘F', which is thought to have stood for ‘Gladys' and ‘Fred' – their nicknames for one another.\nShockingly, Diana had discovered the bracelet just two weeks previously, in the office she shared with Charles's right-hand-man, Michael Colborne. Prince Charles had asked Colborne to buy jewellery as presents for a number of women with whom he had been close during his bachelor years, as a way of thanking them for their companionship.\n'All the jewellery had been delivered to the office that Diana was sharing with Colborne and put on his desk,' Junor explains. 'Colborne was called away to a meeting down the corridor. He left the jewellery on his desk and when he came back he met Diana storming out of the office. He quickly realised she had unpacked the boxes, discovered the bracelet and got into a jealous rage.'\nCamilla attended Charles and Diana's wedding but the pair did not then see one another or communicate for nearly five years – apart from when Charles notified her of the birth of his first son, William.\nIn June 1982, less than a year after Diana and Charles married, their first son, Prince William, was born.\nThis was, for the most part, a happy time for the couple, says Junor. 'I've interviewed people who visited Kensington Palace in the early 1980s – they describe Diana charging about the house playfully looking for William who had run away and hidden under his father's desk at bedtime.\nOthers describe Charles chasing Diana up the stairs. I think there were definitely good times. Diana would later tell journalist Andrew Morton that the period just before Harry was born [in 1984] was the happiest the couple had had together.\nPrincess Diana and Prince Charles leave St Mary's Hospital in London with their newborn son, Prince William. William was born on 21 June 1982. (Photo by)\n'Diana very much enjoyed being a mother, she absolutely loved William and Harry with every fibre of her being. If you are someone who desperately needs love – as, I would argue, Diana did – there's nothing quite like a baby to fulfil that need. So having children was the best possible thing for Diana.'\nBut tensions in the marriage were escalating and Diana's moods were changeable. 'She was incredibly complicated,' says Junor. 'There were behaviours that she exhibited privately but not publicly, and I think this is why the public has always found it very hard to believe anything other than Diana's story. Andrew Morton's biography, for example, is absolutely Diana's story, but it's her story, it's not the story.\n\"The truth is we've never heard Charles's side. Apart from admitting adultery to Jonathan Dimbleby [in his televised 1994 interview] he has never talked about their marriage or criticised his ex-wife in all these years.\n'Ultimately I think Charles did everything he could to try to make Diana happy. But she wanted 101 per cent of Charles's attention all the time, and he was just not the man who would ever have been able to give that to her because the bulk of his attention has always gone on his work.'\nTensions also arose as the press and public lavished attention on Diana over-and-above Charles. During their 1983 tour of Australia – which features in season four of The Crown – Charles is said to have bemoaned the fact he was being outshone by his wife. Junor, who joined the royal couple on their very first royal tour – of Wales shortly after their honeymoon – says Charles was often overshadowed by Diana to the extent it was 'painful to watch'.\nDuring royal tours of towns and cities, thousands of people would line both sides of the street and Charles would meet-and-greet those on one side, Diana the other. 'There were audible sighs and groans from people on Charles's side,' says Junor. 'They would hand Charles bouquets of flowers and ask him to pass them to his wife.'\nDiana, Princess of Wales and Prince Charles visit Yandina Ginger Factory in Queensland, Australia, during their 1983 royal tour of Australia. The tour is expected to feature in season 4 of 'The Crown'. (Photo by Jayne Fincher/Princess)\nThe press were also 'obsessed' with Diana, says Junor. Charles would give a speech about an issue dear to him, such as the environment or a charitable cause, but – much to his frustration – newspaper reports the next day would be dominated by photos of Diana, with commentary on her hairstyle, her weight and her clothes, and often speculation as to whether she was pregnant. There would be no mention of his speech.\n'After a while, this began to really grate on Charles,' says Junor. 'He had spent his whole life being in the spotlight. Members of the royal family do their own engagements, they're used to being the star of the show. So when Charles suddenly found himself being kicked into the wings, with his wife – for all the stupidest reasons, like a hairstyle – suddenly the star, who could blame him for getting a bit peeved?'\nRead more about the start of ‘Dianamania' here\n'I suspect not,' says Junor. 'She was not very well educated. And because she was the product of a divorced couple I think each parent probably spoiled her; I don't think there was any real discipline in her life.\n'If she started something and wanted to give up, she gave up: she'd gone to finishing school but didn't like it, so left; she'd done jobs she hadn't enjoyed, so she'd given them up. And one thing that the royal family has in spades is discipline; their lives are regimented, and I think Diana found that very difficult.\n'Diana had left boarding school with no real qualifications at all and she wasn't a great reader of books. In the late 1970s she studied ballet and briefly taught at the Vacani School of Dance, and she had looked after children briefly as a kindergarten teacher.\n'She had dabbled in lots of things she liked. But with no qualifications she was never going to go anywhere great. She really didn't need to work; she had plenty of money. So if she hadn't met Charles, she probably would have married someone posh and had children, staff and nannies – and an active social life.'\nTo begin with, both the Queen and Prince Philip were very enthusiastic about Diana, says Junor. They'd known her as a child because her family lived at Park House on the Sandringham Estate; her father was an equerry to the Queen. Diana was also a similar age to Prince Andrew and she used to attend parties with him.\n'When Diana stayed at Balmoral in the summer of 1980, the Queen and Prince Philip thought she was enchanting,' says Junor. For many years Charles kept secret the difficulties he and Diana were having in their marriage. 'The Queen and Prince Philip were blissfully unaware,' says Junor. 'But as time went by and they came to learn of the problems in the marriage through the press, they became very irritated with her. Diana's behaviour was damaging the monarchy, and if there's one thing the Queen cares about above all else, it's the monarchy. She is safeguarding it for the future; that's the prime task for any monarch.'\nPrincess Diana with her mother-in-law, the Queen, watching a polo match, May 1987. (Photo by Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images)\nDiana would later tell Andrew Morton that she realised her marriage to Charles was over around the time their second son, Harry, was born, in 1984. According to Diana she was crushed by comments Charles supposedly made following the birth. 'Something inside of me died,' the princess told Morton.\nBy 1986 the marriage had collapsed and Charles was at what Penny Junor describes as 'a critical sort of low'. Two mutual friends, concerned for Charles, independently contacted Camilla and urged her to reach out to him. She picked up the phone to Charles and their friendship restarted from there.\n'Some years later Charles would confirm that Mrs Parker Bowles was a good friend, but insisted he had been faithful to Diana until their marriage had ‘irretrievably broken down',' writes Marlene Koenig.\nCharles and Camilla first saw one another again in 1986 when Charles invited her and her husband, Andrew, for tea at Highgrove. Over the coming months Charles and Camilla's friendship developed and by around 1987 the pair were romantically involved again, says Junor. 'Andrew was still being horribly unfaithful to Camilla and she didn't feel loved or cherished by him in their marriage,' says Junor.\n'Meanwhile Diana by this time had had affairs with several men, the first of which was probably with her bodyguard, Barry Mannakee. James Hewitt [a former cavalry officer in the British Army, with whom Diana admitted to having an affair] was also well in the picture by the time Charles went back to Camilla. Charles and Diana were leading very separate lives by this point.'\nDiana with her bodyguard Barry Mannakee, 1985. (Photo by Tim Graham Photo Library via Getty Images)\nCharles and Diana lived largely separate lives from around 1986, and Charles's affair with Camilla continued. In December 1992, after years of speculation by the tabloid press that the marriage was in jeopardy, British prime minister John Major announced that the couple had formally separated.\nIn the summer of 1994, Charles's interview with Jonathan Dimbleby was televised 'in which he admitted infidelity and revealed both a lack of sympathy for Diana… and a worrying distance from his family,' writes Sarah Gristwood in this article for HistoryExtra .\nThis revelation, says Junor, compelled Andrew Parker Bowles to divorce Camilla. The pair announced their divorce in January 1995. A few months later, in November 1995, Princess Diana gave her famous Panorama interview with Martin Bashir in which she told viewers 'there were three of us in this marriage – so it was a bit crowded'.\nDid Charles ask Camilla to leave her husband, as is shown in The Crown ?\nMartin Bashir interviews Princess Diana in Kensington Palace for the television programme 'Panorama', November 1995.

(Photo by Johnny Eggitt/AFP via Getty Images)\nOn 31 August 1997, Diana was killed in a car accident in Paris. She was 36 years old when she died.\nIn January 1999, Charles and Camilla made their first public appearance together as a couple. Their engagement was announced on 10 February 2005 and they married just a couple of months later on 9 April at a civil wedding at Windsor Guildhall, followed by a Service of Blessing at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.",

To do this, navigate to the 'Wallet' section of your PayPal account and click on 'Link a bank account.' Follow the instructions to provide your bank account details. PayPal will deposit a small amount into your bank account, which you'll need to confirm within a few days to verify the account. Once confirmed, the funds will be returned to your PayPal account. 3.

PayPal may ask you to confirm your address by uploading a document that shows your name and address, such as a utility bill or bank statement. This document should be current and must match the address you provided during the registration process. Once you have completed these verification steps, your PayPal account will be fully verified, and you'll have access to all the features and benefits that come with it. Verified accounts enjoy higher transaction limits, enhanced security protocols, and a trusted reputation within the PayPal community.

Click on the bank account you added and follow the instructions to enter the amounts of the deposits. This confirms that you are the account holder and allows PayPal to link and verify your bank account. 5.
